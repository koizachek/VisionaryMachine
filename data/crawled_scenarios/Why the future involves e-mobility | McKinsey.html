<p><strong>That hum in the distance</strong> is the sound of the concept of mobility changingâfor the better. While challenges to the electrification of the vehicle parc persist, opportunities worth fighting for also lay ahead. This is particularly evident in cities, where emissions, congestion, and safety constitute major issues today. If the status quo continues, mobility problems will intensify as population and GDP growth drive increased car ownership and vehicle miles traveled. In response, the mobility industry is unleashing a dazzling array of innovations designed for urban roads, such as mobility-as-a-service, advanced traffic management and parking systems, freight-sharing solutions, and new transportation concepts on two or three wheels.</p>

<p>The current opportunity to transform the way we move fundamentally results from changes in three main areas: regulation, consumer behavior, and technology.</p>
<p><strong>Regulation. </strong>Governments and cities have introduced regulations and incentives to <a href="/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/the-futures-of-mobility-how-cities-can-benefit">accelerate the shift to sustainable mobility</a>. Regulators worldwide are defining more stringent emissions targets. The European Union presented its âFit for 55â program, which seeks to align climate, energy, land use, transport, and taxation policies to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, and the Biden administration introduced a 50 percent electric vehicle (EV) target for 2030. Beyond such mandates, most governments are also offering EV subsidies.</p>
<p>Cities are working to reduce private vehicle use and congestion by offering greater support for alternative mobility modes like bicycles. Paris announced it will invest more than $300 million to update its bicycle network and convert 50 kilometers of car lanes into bicycle lanes. Many urban areas are also implementing access regulations for cars. In fact, over 150 cities in Europe have already created access regulations for low emissions and pollution emergencies.</p>
<!-- -->
<p><strong>Consumer behavior. </strong>Consumer behavior and awareness are changing as more people accept alternative and sustainable mobility modes. Inner city trips with shared bicycles and e-scooters have risen 60 percent year-over-year and the latest McKinsey consumer survey suggests average bicycle use (shared and private) may increase more than 10 percent in the post-pandemic world compared with pre-pandemic levels (See also â<a href="/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-micromobility-ridership-and-revenue-after-a-crisis">The future of micromobility: Ridership and revenue after a crisis</a>,â July 2020). In addition, consumers are becoming more open to shared mobility options. More than 20 percent of Germans surveyed say they already use ride-pooling services (6 percent do so at least once per week), which can help reduce vehicle miles traveled and emissions (See also â<a href="/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/shared-mobility-where-it-stands-where-its-headed">Shared mobility: Where it stands, where itâs headed</a>,â August 2021).</p>
<p><strong>Technology. </strong>Industry players are accelerating the speed of automotive technology innovation as they develop new concepts of electric, connected, autonomous, and shared mobility. The industry has attracted more than $400 billion in investments over the last decadeâwith about $100 billion of that coming since the beginning of 2020. All this money targets companies and start-ups working on electrifying mobility, connecting vehicles, and autonomous driving technology (See also â<a href="/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/mobilitys-future-an-investment-reality-check">Mobilityâs future: An investment reality check</a>,â April 2021). Such technology innovations will help reduce EV costs and make electric shared mobility a real alternative to owning a car.</p>
<p>Electrification will play an important role in the transformation of the mobility industry and presents major opportunities in all vehicle segments, although the pace and extent of change will differ. To ensure the fast, widespread adoption of electric mobility, launching new EVs in the market is an important first step. In addition, the entire mobility ecosystem must work to make the transformation successful, from EV manufacturers and suppliers to financers, dealers, energy providers, and charging station operatorsâto name only a few (Exhibit 1).</p>

<h2>The future of passenger vehicle powertrains is electric; the transformation is ongoing</h2>
<p>The tipping point in passenger EV adoption occurred in the second half of 2020, when EV sales and penetration accelerated in major markets despite the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Europe spearheaded this development, where EV adoption reached 8 percent due to policy mandates such as stricter emissions targets for OEMs and generous subsidies for consumers.</p>
<p>In 2021, the discussions have centered on the end date for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle sales. New regulatory targets in the European Union and the United States now aim for an EV share of at least 50 percent by 2030, and several countries have announced accelerated timelines for ICE sales bans in 2030 or 2035. Some OEMs have stated their intentions to stop investing in new ICE platforms and models and many more have already defined a specific date to end ICE vehicle production. Consumer mindsets have also shifted toward sustainable mobility, with more than 45 percent of car customers considering buying an EV.</p>
<p>However, the continued acceleration of electrification is putting significant pressure on OEMs, their supply chains, and the broader EV ecosystem to meet these targets. This is particularly obvious with respect to setting up the required charging infrastructure.</p>
<h2>By 2035, the largest automotive markets will go electric</h2>
<p>Regulatory pressure and the consumer pull toward EVs vary greatly by region. Europe is mainly a regulation-driven market with high subsidies, while in China consumer pull is very strong despite reduced incentives. In the United States, EV sales have grown slowly due to both limited regulatory pressure and consumer interest, although the regulator trend is set to change under the new administration.</p>
<p>On a global level, we expect EV (BEV, PHEV, and FCEV)<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a data-testid="article-footnote" aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined " aria-describedby="2a1e16f6-6f69-42b8-8e23-1810cc53048b"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">1</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="2a1e16f6-6f69-42b8-8e23-1810cc53048b" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">Battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and fuel cell electric vehicles.</span></span></span></a></span> adoption to reach 45 percent under currently expected regulatory targets. However, even this transformative EV growth outlook is far below whatâs required to achieve net zero emissions. EVs would need to account for 75 percent of passenger car sales globally by 2030, which significantly outpaces the current course and speed of the industry.</p>
<p>We believe Europeâas a regulatory-driven market with positive consumer demand trendsâwill electrify the fastest and is expected to remain the global leader in electrification in terms of EV market share. In addition to the European Commission target, which requires around 60 percent EV sales by 2030, several countries have already announced an end to ICE sales by 2030. In line with this, seven OEM brands have committed to 100 percent EV sales by 2030 within the European Union. In the most likely accelerated scenario, consumer adoption will exceed regulatory targets and Europe will reach around 75 percent EV market share by 2030. The European Union announced a zero-emissions target for new cars by 2035.</p>

<p>China will also continue to see strong growth in electrification and remain the largest EV market in absolute terms. Uptake results from strong consumer pull, despite low EV subsidies and no official end date for ICE sales. However, the governmentâs dual-credit policy has led to an increased EV share in OEMsâ portfolios. Our adoption modeling yields a Chinese EV share above 70 percent for new car sales in 2030 in the accelerated scenario.</p>
<p>In the United States, the Biden administration announced a 50 percent electrification target for 2030, strong investments in charging infrastructure, and more stringent fleet emissions targets. EV uptake will result mainly from regulatory support in California and other states that follow its CARB ZEV regulation. US OEMs support electrification targets and have declared ICE bans by 2035, meaning the United States will follow Europe and China in EV uptake with a small delay; it is expected to exceed current regulatory targets and reach 65 percent EV sales by 2030 in the accelerated scenario (Exhibit 2).</p>

<h2>The e-mobility transformation will disrupt more than the automotive industry</h2>
<p>In the European Union, achieving the accelerated scenario of around 75 percent EV sales by 2030 will have implications for the entire EV value chain and ecosystem. In parallel, the industry must decarbonize the full lifecycle of vehicles to get closer to a net-zero target.</p>
<p>Incumbent automotive suppliers need to shift production from ICE to EV components. Europe will have to build an estimated 24 new battery giga-factories to supply local passenger EV battery demand. With more than 70 million EVs on the road by 2030, the industry will need to install large numbers of public chargers and provide maintenance operations for them. Renewable electricity production needs to increase by 5 percent to meet EV charging demand. Finally, emissions from BEV production must decline, since BEVs currently have 80 percent higher emissions in production than ICE vehicles (Exhibit 3).</p>

<h3>Electrification will cause a major shift in the entire automotive supply chain</h3>
<p>The transformation of the automotive industry toward electrification will disrupt the entire supply chain and create a significant shift in market size for automotive components. Critical components for electrification such as batteries and electric drives and for autonomous driving like light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors and radar sensors will likely make up about 52 percent of the total market size by 2030. Components only used in ICE vehicles such as conventional transmissions, engines, and fuel injection systems would see a significant decline to around 11 percent by 2030âabout half the size of 2019 levels. Such a drastic shift will force traditional component players to adapt quickly to offset decreasing revenue streams.</p>
<p>The scale of disruption will be significant: according to the Institute for Economic Research (Ifo) in Munich, more than 100,000 jobs will change in the German automotive industry by 2030. That is roughly five to ten times the scale of jobs compared with the phaseout of coal power that Germany announced for 2038 (Exhibit 4).</p>

<h3>Announced EU battery production will likely stay just ahead of demand</h3>
<p>Based on announced buildup plans, we expect a 20-fold increase in battery production capacity in Europe to 965 GWh by 2030. Assuming the full capacity is built by 2030, Europe should meet expected demand of 874 GWh. BEV passenger cars and commercial vehicles will drive 90 percent of this battery demand. While on paper announced capacities seem to follow and match demand, in reality temporary implementation risks will likely occur given giga-factory production issues, typically slow yield ramp-ups, fragmentation of the supply chain, and large inflexible OEM contracts. Thus, in an accelerated EV adoption case, battery demand would come very close to exceeding announced supply in the medium term. In the next ten years, we expect the mining industry to slow down and other geopolitical and supply chain crises to pop up periodically, leading to some short-term price spikes in commodities like nickel and lithium.</p>
<p>Battery cell production is moving physically closer to vehicle assembly plants. While ten years ago almost all cells were imported from Asia, regional production hubs exist today in Eastern Europe, for example. Furthermore, multiple plants will go onstream in key vehicle-producing countries like Germany, the United Kingdom, and France and in low-carbon-emitting environments such as Norway and Sweden.</p>
<p>In addition to incumbent battery cell players from Asia setting up locations in Europe, some entirely new companies are entering the space. One key development in battery sourcing involves the backward integration of OEMs from packs and modules up to cell productionâmostly in the form of joint ventures with cell manufacturers. OEM backward integration plans result from their growing battery cell demand, the desire for control and certainty of supply, and the ambition to keep a significant part of vehicle value creation inhouse. OEMs are also seeking areas for differentiation, with battery technology, durability, and performance seen as key evaluation criteria for BEVs.</p>
<p>Production of raw materials and battery components follow the localization trend of battery cell plants. However, there is a time lag and only some of the raw materials needed, which include nickel, cobalt, lithium, and graphite, are available for local sourcing in Europe. Companies must therefore compete globally to secure required volumes and do it sustainably in line with environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. While all four commodities must ramp up quickly, with potential price variation in the future, nickel will likely be the commodity under the most pressure in the short to medium term (Exhibit 5).</p>

<h3>Acceleration in charging infrastructure buildup needed</h3>
<p>In line with EV uptake, the buildup of charging infrastructure needs to accelerate to avoid becoming a potential bottleneck and limiting consumer-driven EV adoption. Building charging infrastructure in sync with the EV fleet will be essential in the coming decade.</p>
<p>While first-generation EV buyers relied mainly on private charging (in 2020, 80 percent of EV buyers in Europe had access to private charging), the next generation will depend on public charging. More than 50 percent of Europeans will be living in multifamily homes without private charger access, and public chargers will ensure practicality of EVs for long-distance trips, which prospective EV buyers still consider a main concern.</p>
<p>Likewise, regulatory processes to install chargers in private homes require simplification and production capacity for wall boxes must increase. Production scale-up and simplified regulation (in terms of shortened permit and building times) are also necessary for public chargers, in addition to the creation of demand-based coverage.</p>
<p>We estimate the industry needs to install more than 15,000 chargers per week by 2030 within the European Union. Simplified regulations are needed to facilitate charger siting, since it can currently take up to three years to obtain approval for grid extensions for a fast-charging station. Ensuring the EU-wide coverage of public charging is essential to avoid having chargers located only in profitable locations.</p>
<p>EVs are poised to command on average more than 5 percent of electricity demand in 2030 in Europe. It will be important to reduce charging during peak load periods through âmanaged chargingâ by controlling charging time, duration, and intensity with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology as an enabler. In a scenario with appropriately managed charging devices in place as well as incentives to charge during nonpeak hours, much of the customer impact on the electric grid will be mitigated (Exhibit 6).</p>

<h3>Reaching net zero also means decarbonizing EV production</h3>
<p>There is a clear path to reducing CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e) emissions from passenger cars in operation. A recent International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) analysis stated that the shift from ICE to BEV would reduce total lifecycle CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions by around 65 percent based on the current average energy mix in Europe and by 83 percent with entirely green electricity.</p>
<p>As the electricity supply evolves and charging with green energy for a larger fleet of EVs becomes feasible, materials and production will become the dominant sources of emissions in an EVâs lifecycle. Today an EVâs production generates an almost 80 percent higher emissions intensity compared with an ICE car, due mainly to the battery and the vehicleâs higher share of aluminum.</p>

<p>When aiming to reduce material emissions, two main issues matter:</p>
<p><strong>Increasing recycled content. </strong>Replacing virgin/primary materials with recycled alternatives will save a large share of emissions associated with the initial generation of raw materials. Replacing 30 percent of primary material with recycled material can save 15 to 25 percent<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a data-testid="article-footnote" aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined " aria-describedby="23d33307-2c09-4f17-a1da-9245b7bf597c"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">2</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="23d33307-2c09-4f17-a1da-9245b7bf597c" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">The abatement rate depends on the level of required treatment of end-of-life (EOL) materials for reuse and the type of material.</span></span></span></a></span> of production emissions. Recycled material use, however, comes with multiple challenges, including the reality that end-of-life (EOL) collection remains very immature, making it difficult to achieve an automotive-grade materials stream. Furthermore, multiple industries are interested in using recycled material to achieve their decarbonization targets, which will result in supply bottlenecks and the higher prices of several recycled materials.</p>
<p><strong>Shifting to green raw materials. </strong>Using primary materials produced in a low/no-carbon process enables high-grade materials with low emissions footprints. Examples of this approach include inert anode aluminum smelting via hydroelectricity or steel produced through hydrogen-based direct reduced iron in an electric arc furnace (H2 DRI-EAF steel). Around 80 to 90 percent of todayâs typical material emissions can be eliminated with 2030 technologies. The main approaches involve decarbonizing the raw material refining processes by using renewable electricity, for example, and decarbonizing the forming as well as other high-energy manufacturing processes, also via electrification.</p>
<p>While a switch in electricity resources is simple, the shift from todayâs processes to manufacturing routes that avoid CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions altogetherârather than capturing or gradually reducing themâwill require significant investments in plants and equipment. A predictable demand for green materials and long-term commitments between suppliers and buyers would help overcome this obstacle in the next decade.</p>
<p>A determined approach to decarbonizing and combining these methods could produce vehicles with 10 to 30 percent of todayâs production emissions by 2030âa challenging feat but necessary to fulfill the Green Deal aspiration. Nevertheless, decarbonizing the supply chain and achieving Scope 3 emissions reductions may cause vehicle costs to rise at a time when OEMs are trying to lower prices to boost consumer interest and achieve sustainable long-term margins (Exhibit 7).</p>

<h3>A 55 percent transport emissions reduction target by 2030 versus 1990 requires more drastic measures</h3>
<p>Current regulation and targets are not sufficient if the road transport sector wants to fully contribute to the 55 percent CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions reduction target by 2030 versus 1990 as required by the Fit for 55 program.</p>
<p>However, passenger cars have one advantage over other industries from a decarbonization point: The zero-emissions option (e.g., the BEV) is cheaper than the current alternative (ICE) from a total cost of ownership perspective in some countries today and by 2025 at the latest in countries without incentives. This is not the case in most other industries, where decarbonizing results in higher costs for both producers and consumers.</p>

<p>However, with the average car age at ten years in Europe, it will take time for EV sales to have an impact at the parc level. The current regulation on sales is therefore not sufficient to meet the goal of a 55 percent emissions reduction from 1990 levels by 2030.</p>
<p>Closing this gap will require further measures targeting CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions of the vehicle parc. ICE vehicle kilometers traveled could be decreased by reducing private car kilometers, increasing shared mobility, and changing consumer perspectives on walking/biking.</p>
<p>At the same time, the most efficient lever is to accelerate the ICE parc turnover and remove highly polluting ICE vehicles from the fleet with, for example, âcash-for-clunkersâ programs for old ICE cars.</p>
<p>Another way to reduce CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions from ICE vehicles is to increase the share of bio- and e-fuels as these have a low carbon footprint and are compatible with the existing ICE parc. However, the majority of bio- and e-fuels supply will be required to decarbonize marine/aviation and commercial road transport, for which only limited zero-emissions alternatives exist today (Exhibit 8).</p>

<p>Electric vehicles are coming, and we are on the right track regarding decarbonizing the transport sector, though more actions need to be taken. It is an industry transformation taking place at unprecedented speed. It is also crossing industry borders, involving energy, infrastructure, mobility, and automotive players. While a major challenge, it represents a huge opportunity for incumbents and new players to take a leading role in creating new multi-billion industries and jobs. The key will be to couple sustainability with economic viability through innovative technology and properly guided mobility transformation. Based on its diverse mobility landscape, its focus on sustainability and its proven technology leadership, Europe could emerge as a role model for other regions globally.</p></div><div class="container-placeholder"></div></div></div><div class="mdc-u-grid mdc-u-grid-gutter-xl"><section role="contentinfo" data-layer-region="article-about-authors" class="mdc-u-grid mdc-u-grid-col-md-12 AboutAuthor_mck-c-about-author__6XnRz"><div class="mdc-u-grid-col-md-start-2 mdc-u-grid-col-md-end-12 mdc-u-grid-col-lg-start-3 mdc-u-grid-col-lg-end-11"><h5 class="mdc-c-heading mdc-c-heading--title mdc-c-heading--border mdc-u-align-center"></h5><div class="mdc-c-description mdc-u-ts-8 mck-u-links-inline mck-u-links-inline--secondary mdc-u-mt-5"><div><p><a href="/our-people/andreas-cornet"><strong>Andreas Cornet</strong></a> is a senior partner based in McKinsey's Munich office, where <strong>Julian Conzade</strong> is a solution manager, <strong>Patrick Schaufuss</strong> is a partner, <strong>Stephanie Schenk</strong> is an expert, and <a href="/our-people/andreas-tschiesner"><strong>Andreas Tschiesner</strong></a>&nbsp;is a senior partner;&nbsp;<span><strong><a href="/our-people/russell-hensley">Russell Hensley</a></strong> is a partner in the Detroit office;</span>&nbsp;<a href="/our-people/patrick-hertzke"><strong>Patrick Hertzke</strong></a>&nbsp;is a partner in the London office;&nbsp;<a href="/our-people/ruth-heuss"><strong>Ruth Heuss</strong></a>&nbsp;is a senior partner in the Berlin office;&nbsp;and <strong>Karsten von Laufenberg</strong> is an associate partner in the Cologne office, where <a href="/our-people/timo-moller"><strong>Timo M&ouml;ller</strong></a>&nbsp;is a partner. </p>

mobility changing\u0026mdash;for the better. While challenges to the electrification of the vehicle parc persist, opportunities worth fighting for also lay ahead. This is particularly evident in cities, where emissions, congestion, and safety constitute major issues today. If the status quo continues, mobility problems will intensify as population and GDP growth drive increased car ownership and vehicle miles traveled. In response, the mobility industry is unleashing a dazzling array of innovations designed for urban roads, such as mobility-as-a-service, advanced traffic management and parking systems, freight-sharing solutions, and new transportation concepts on two or three wheels.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Sidebar authors]]\n\u003cp\u003eThe current opportunity to transform the way we move fundamentally results from changes in three main areas: regulation, consumer behavior, and technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRegulation. \u003c/strong\u003eGovernments and cities have introduced regulations and incentives to \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/the-futures-of-mobility-how-cities-can-benefit\"\u003eaccelerate the shift to sustainable mobility\u003c/a\u003e. Regulators worldwide are defining more stringent emissions targets. The European Union presented its \u0026ldquo;Fit for 55\u0026rdquo; program, which seeks to align climate, energy, land use, transport, and taxation policies to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, and the Biden administration introduced a 50 percent electric vehicle (EV) target for 2030. Beyond such mandates, most governments are also offering EV subsidies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCities are working to reduce private vehicle use and congestion by offering greater support for alternative mobility modes like bicycles. Paris announced it will invest more than $300 million to update its bicycle network and convert 50 kilometers of car lanes into bicycle lanes. Many urban areas are also implementing access regulations for cars. In fact, over 150 cities in Europe have already created access regulations for low emissions and pollution emergencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[MostPopularArticles 5]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConsumer behavior. \u003c/strong\u003eConsumer behavior and awareness are changing as more people accept alternative and sustainable mobility modes. Inner city trips with shared bicycles and e-scooters have risen 60 percent year-over-year and the latest McKinsey consumer survey suggests average bicycle use (shared and private) may increase more than 10 percent in the post-pandemic world compared with pre-pandemic levels (See also \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-micromobility-ridership-and-revenue-after-a-crisis\"\u003eThe future of micromobility: Ridership and revenue after a crisis\u003c/a\u003e,\u0026rdquo; July 2020). In addition, consumers are becoming more open to shared mobility options. More than 20 percent of Germans surveyed say they already use ride-pooling services (6 percent do so at least once per week), which can help reduce vehicle miles traveled and emissions (See also \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/shared-mobility-where-it-stands-where-its-headed\"\u003eShared mobility: Where it stands, where it\u0026rsquo;s headed\u003c/a\u003e,\u0026rdquo; August 2021).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTechnology. \u003c/strong\u003eIndustry players are accelerating the speed of automotive technology innovation as they develop new concepts of electric, connected, autonomous, and shared mobility. The industry has attracted more than $400 billion in investments over the last decade\u0026mdash;with about $100 billion of that coming since the beginning of 2020. All this money targets companies and start-ups working on electrifying mobility, connecting vehicles, and autonomous driving technology (See also \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/mobilitys-future-an-investment-reality-check\"\u003eMobility\u0026rsquo;s future: An investment reality check\u003c/a\u003e,\u0026rdquo; April 2021). Such technology innovations will help reduce EV costs and make electric shared mobility a real alternative to owning a car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElectrification will play an important role in the transformation of the mobility industry and presents major opportunities in all vehicle segments, although the pace and extent of change will differ. To ensure the fast, widespread adoption of electric mobility, launching new EVs in the market is an important first step. In addition, the entire mobility ecosystem must work to make the transformation successful, from EV manufacturers and suppliers to financers, dealers, energy providers, and charging station operators\u0026mdash;to name only a few (Exhibit 1).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 1]]\n\u003ch2\u003eThe future of passenger vehicle powertrains is electric; the transformation is ongoing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tipping point in passenger EV adoption occurred in the second half of 2020, when EV sales and penetration accelerated in major markets despite the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Europe spearheaded this development, where EV adoption reached 8 percent due to policy mandates such as stricter emissions targets for OEMs and generous subsidies for consumers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2021, the discussions have centered on the end date for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle sales. New regulatory targets in the European Union and the United States now aim for an EV share of at least 50 percent by 2030, and several countries have announced accelerated timelines for ICE sales bans in 2030 or 2035. Some OEMs have stated their intentions to stop investing in new ICE platforms and models and many more have already defined a specific date to end ICE vehicle production. Consumer mindsets have also shifted toward sustainable mobility, with more than 45 percent of car customers considering buying an EV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the continued acceleration of electrification is putting significant pressure on OEMs, their supply chains, and the broader EV ecosystem to meet these targets. This is particularly obvious with respect to setting up the required charging infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBy 2035, the largest automotive markets will go electric\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegulatory pressure and the consumer pull toward EVs vary greatly by region. Europe is mainly a regulation-driven market with high subsidies, while in China consumer pull is very strong despite reduced incentives. In the United States, EV sales have grown slowly due to both limited regulatory pressure and consumer interest, although the regulator trend is set to change under the new administration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a global level, we expect EV (BEV, PHEV, and FCEV)[[Footnote 1]] adoption to reach 45 percent under currently expected regulatory targets. However, even this transformative EV growth outlook is far below what\u0026rsquo;s required to achieve net zero emissions. EVs would need to account for 75 percent of passenger car sales globally by 2030, which significantly outpaces the current course and speed of the industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe believe Europe\u0026mdash;as a regulatory-driven market with positive consumer demand trends\u0026mdash;will electrify the fastest and is expected to remain the global leader in electrification in terms of EV market share. In addition to the European Commission target, which requires around 60 percent EV sales by 2030, several countries have already announced an end to ICE sales by 2030. In line with this, seven OEM brands have committed to 100 percent EV sales by 2030 within the European Union. In the most likely accelerated scenario, consumer adoption will exceed regulatory targets and Europe will reach around 75 percent EV market share by 2030. The European Union announced a zero-emissions target for new cars by 2035.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Disruptor1Up dis1]]\n\u003cp\u003eChina will also continue to see strong growth in electrification and remain the largest EV market in absolute terms. Uptake results from strong consumer pull, despite low EV subsidies and no official end date for ICE sales. However, the government\u0026rsquo;s dual-credit policy has led to an increased EV share in OEMs\u0026rsquo; portfolios. Our adoption modeling yields a Chinese EV share above 70 percent for new car sales in 2030 in the accelerated scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the United States, the Biden administration announced a 50 percent electrification target for 2030, strong investments in charging infrastructure, and more stringent fleet emissions targets. EV uptake will result mainly from regulatory support in California and other states that follow its CARB ZEV regulation. US OEMs support electrification targets and have declared ICE bans by 2035, meaning the United States will follow Europe and China in EV uptake with a small delay; it is expected to exceed current regulatory targets and reach 65 percent EV sales by 2030 in the accelerated scenario (Exhibit 2).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 2]]\n\u003ch2\u003eThe e-mobility transformation will disrupt more than the automotive industry\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the European Union, achieving the accelerated scenario of around 75 percent EV sales by 2030 will have implications for the entire EV value chain and ecosystem. In parallel, the industry must decarbonize the full lifecycle of vehicles to get closer to a net-zero target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncumbent automotive suppliers need to shift production from ICE to EV components. Europe will have to build an estimated 24 new battery giga-factories to supply local passenger EV battery demand. With more than 70 million EVs on the road by 2030, the industry will need to install large numbers of public chargers and provide maintenance operations for them. Renewable electricity production needs to increase by 5 percent to meet EV charging demand. Finally, emissions from BEV production must decline, since BEVs currently have 80 percent higher emissions in production than ICE vehicles (Exhibit 3).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 3]]\n\u003ch3\u003eElectrification will cause a major shift in the entire automotive supply chain\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe transformation of the automotive industry toward electrification will disrupt the entire supply chain and create a significant shift in market size for automotive components. Critical components for electrification such as batteries and electric drives and for autonomous driving like light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors and radar sensors will likely make up about 52 percent of the total market size by 2030. Components only used in ICE vehicles such as conventional transmissions, engines, and fuel injection systems would see a significant decline to around 11 percent by 2030\u0026mdash;about half the size of 2019 levels. Such a drastic shift will force traditional component players to adapt quickly to offset decreasing revenue streams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scale of disruption will be significant: according to the Institute for Economic Research (Ifo) in Munich, more than 100,000 jobs will change in the German automotive industry by 2030. That is roughly five to ten times the scale of jobs compared with the phaseout of coal power that Germany announced for 2038 (Exhibit 4).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 4]]\n\u003ch3\u003eAnnounced EU battery production will likely stay just ahead of demand\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on announced buildup plans, we expect a 20-fold increase in battery production capacity in Europe to 965 GWh by 2030. Assuming the full capacity is built by 2030, Europe should meet expected demand of 874 GWh. BEV passenger cars and commercial vehicles will drive 90 percent of this battery demand. While on paper announced capacities seem to follow and match demand, in reality temporary implementation risks will likely occur given giga-factory production issues, typically slow yield ramp-ups, fragmentation of the supply chain, and large inflexible OEM contracts. Thus, in an accelerated EV adoption case, battery demand would come very close to exceeding announced supply in the medium term. In the next ten years, we expect the mining industry to slow down and other geopolitical and supply chain crises to pop up periodically, leading to some short-term price spikes in commodities like nickel and lithium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBattery cell production is moving physically closer to vehicle assembly plants. While ten years ago almost all cells were imported from Asia, regional production hubs exist today in Eastern Europe, for example. Furthermore, multiple plants will go onstream in key vehicle-producing countries like Germany, the United Kingdom, and France and in low-carbon-emitting environments such as Norway and Sweden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to incumbent battery cell players from Asia setting up locations in Europe, some entirely new companies are entering the space. One key development in battery sourcing involves the backward integration of OEMs from packs and modules up to cell production\u0026mdash;mostly in the form of joint ventures with cell manufacturers. OEM backward integration plans result from their growing battery cell demand, the desire for control and certainty of supply, and the ambition to keep a significant part of vehicle value creation inhouse. OEMs are also seeking areas for differentiation, with battery technology, durability, and performance seen as key evaluation criteria for BEVs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProduction of raw materials and battery components follow the localization trend of battery cell plants. However, there is a time lag and only some of the raw materials needed, which include nickel, cobalt, lithium, and graphite, are available for local sourcing in Europe. Companies must therefore compete globally to secure required volumes and do it sustainably in line with environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. While all four commodities must ramp up quickly, with potential price variation in the future, nickel will likely be the commodity under the most pressure in the short to medium term (Exhibit 5).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 5]]\n\u003ch3\u003eAcceleration in charging infrastructure buildup needed\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn line with EV uptake, the buildup of charging infrastructure needs to accelerate to avoid becoming a potential bottleneck and limiting consumer-driven EV adoption. Building charging infrastructure in sync with the EV fleet will be essential in the coming decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile first-generation EV buyers relied mainly on private charging (in 2020, 80 percent of EV buyers in Europe had access to private charging), the next generation will depend on public charging. More than 50 percent of Europeans will be living in multifamily homes without private charger access, and public chargers will ensure practicality of EVs for long-distance trips, which prospective EV buyers still consider a main concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLikewise, regulatory processes to install chargers in private homes require simplification and production capacity for wall boxes must increase. Production scale-up and simplified regulation (in terms of shortened permit and building times) are also necessary for public chargers, in addition to the creation of demand-based coverage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe estimate the industry needs to install more than 15,000 chargers per week by 2030 within the European Union. Simplified regulations are needed to facilitate charger siting, since it can currently take up to three years to obtain approval for grid extensions for a fast-charging station. Ensuring the EU-wide coverage of public charging is essential to avoid having chargers located only in profitable locations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEVs are poised to command on average more than 5 percent of electricity demand in 2030 in Europe. It will be important to reduce charging during peak load periods through \u0026ldquo;managed charging\u0026rdquo; by controlling charging time, duration, and intensity with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology as an enabler. In a scenario with appropriately managed charging devices in place as well as incentives to charge during nonpeak hours, much of the customer impact on the electric grid will be mitigated (Exhibit 6).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 6]]\n\u003ch3\u003eReaching net zero also means decarbonizing EV production\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a clear path to reducing CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e equivalent (CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003ee) emissions from passenger cars in operation. A recent International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) analysis stated that the shift from ICE to BEV would reduce total lifecycle CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003ee emissions by around 65 percent based on the current average energy mix in Europe and by 83 percent with entirely green electricity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the electricity supply evolves and charging with green energy for a larger fleet of EVs becomes feasible, materials and production will become the dominant sources of emissions in an EV\u0026rsquo;s lifecycle. Today an EV\u0026rsquo;s production generates an almost 80 percent higher emissions intensity compared with an ICE car, due mainly to the battery and the vehicle\u0026rsquo;s higher share of aluminum.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Disruptor1Up dis2]]\n\u003cp\u003eWhen aiming to reduce material emissions, two main issues matter:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIncreasing recycled content. \u003c/strong\u003eReplacing virgin/primary materials with recycled alternatives will save a large share of emissions associated with the initial generation of raw materials. Replacing 30 percent of primary material with recycled material can save 15 to 25 percent[[Footnote 2]] of production emissions. Recycled material use, however, comes with multiple challenges, including the reality that end-of-life (EOL) collection remains very immature, making it difficult to achieve an automotive-grade materials stream. Furthermore, multiple industries are interested in using recycled material to achieve their decarbonization targets, which will result in supply bottlenecks and the higher prices of several recycled materials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShifting to green raw materials. \u003c/strong\u003eUsing primary materials produced in a low/no-carbon process enables high-grade materials with low emissions footprints. Examples of this approach include inert anode aluminum smelting via hydroelectricity or steel produced through hydrogen-based direct reduced iron in an electric arc furnace (H2 DRI-EAF steel). Around 80 to 90 percent of today\u0026rsquo;s typical material emissions can be eliminated with 2030 technologies. The main approaches involve decarbonizing the raw material refining processes by using renewable electricity, for example, and decarbonizing the forming as well as other high-energy manufacturing processes, also via electrification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile a switch in electricity resources is simple, the shift from today\u0026rsquo;s processes to manufacturing routes that avoid CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003ee emissions altogether\u0026mdash;rather than capturing or gradually reducing them\u0026mdash;will require significant investments in plants and equipment. A predictable demand for green materials and long-term commitments between suppliers and buyers would help overcome this obstacle in the next decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA determined approach to decarbonizing and combining these methods could produce vehicles with 10 to 30 percent of today\u0026rsquo;s production emissions by 2030\u0026mdash;a challenging feat but necessary to fulfill the Green Deal aspiration. Nevertheless, decarbonizing the supply chain and achieving Scope 3 emissions reductions may cause vehicle costs to rise at a time when OEMs are trying to lower prices to boost consumer interest and achieve sustainable long-term margins (Exhibit 7).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 7]]\n\u003ch3\u003eA 55 percent transport emissions reduction target by 2030 versus 1990 requires more drastic measures\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrent regulation and targets are not sufficient if the road transport sector wants to fully contribute to the 55 percent CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003ee emissions reduction target by 2030 versus 1990 as required by the Fit for 55 program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, passenger cars have one advantage over other industries from a decarbonization point: The zero-emissions option (e.g., the BEV) is cheaper than the current alternative (ICE) from a total cost of ownership perspective in some countries today and by 2025 at the latest in countries without incentives. This is not the case in most other industries, where decarbonizing results in higher costs for both producers and consumers.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Sidebar 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, with the average car age at ten years in Europe, it will take time for EV sales to have an impact at the parc level. The current regulation on sales is therefore not sufficient to meet the goal of a 55 percent emissions reduction from 1990 levels by 2030.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing this gap will require further measures targeting CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003ee emissions of the vehicle parc. ICE vehicle kilometers traveled could be decreased by reducing private car kilometers, increasing shared mobility, and changing consumer perspectives on walking/biking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the most efficient lever is to accelerate the ICE parc turnover and remove highly polluting ICE vehicles from the fleet with, for example, \u0026ldquo;cash-for-clunkers\u0026rdquo; programs for old ICE cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother way to reduce CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003ee emissions from ICE vehicles is to increase the share of bio- and e-fuels as these have a low carbon footprint and are compatible with the existing ICE parc. However, the majority of bio- and e-fuels supply will be required to decarbonize marine/aviation and commercial road transport, for which only limited zero-emissions alternatives exist today (Exhibit 8).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 8]]\n\u003cp\u003eElectric vehicles are coming, and we are on the right track regarding decarbonizing the transport sector, though more actions need to be taken. It is an industry transformation taking place at unprecedented speed. It is also crossing industry borders, involving energy, infrastructure, mobility, and automotive players. While a major challenge, it represents a huge opportunity for incumbents and new players to take a leading role in creating new multi-billion industries and jobs. The key will be to couple sustainability with economic viability through innovative technology and properly guided mobility transformation. Based on its diverse mobility landscape, its focus on sustainability and its proven technology leadership, Europe could emerge as a role model for other regions globally.\u003c/p\u003e"},"Link4":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link5":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link3":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link2":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link1":{"value":{"href":""}},"Related Articles":[{"id":"98c74bed-1ec5-4158-a6e6-0c2cffb75691","url":"/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-micromobility-ridership-and-revenue-after-a-crisis","name":"The future of micromobility Ridership and revenue after a crisis","displayName":"The future of micromobility Ridership and revenue after a crisis","fields":{"Mobile Ready":{"value":true},"Exclude from RSS":{"value":false},"Exclude from ClientLink":{"value":false},"Apple News Article ID":{"value":""},"For Clients Only":{"value":false},"Source Publication":null,"Primary Destination":[],"Contributory Practice":"{535F1DB4-17F6-4C36-8CA8-B169A242F998}","Closer Tout Text":{"value":""},"Article Type":{"name":"Article","displayName":"Article","id":"{0ABBC29E-46EE-470B-A93B-C31F735E753A}","fields":{}},"Tout Text":{"value":""},"Thumbnail Image Mobile":{"value":{}},"Featured Image Mobile":{"value":{}},"Browse Image Mobile":{"value":{}},"Interactive Content":{"value":""},"Authors":"{5985E50C-459B-43EC-B9C8-C2B077EFBFC5}|{7E0D10EE-30D4-41BA-BA02-3B0648A6E1B1}|{9F30B94A-CDEC-4B78-AC88-C12C260E0C2F}","UseEnhancedAuthors":{"value":false},"Acknowledgements":{"value":""},"About The Authors":{"value":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"/our-people/kersten-heineke\"\u003eKersten Heineke\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e leads the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility and is a partner in McKinsey\u0026rsquo;s Frankfurt office, where \u003cstrong\u003eBenedikt Kloss\u003c/strong\u003e is an associate partner; \u003cstrong\u003eDarius Scurtu\u003c/strong\u003e is a knowledge analyst in the Munich office. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis article was edited by Belinda Yu, an assistant managing editor in the Atlanta office.\u003c/p\u003e"},"Hide ByLine":{"value":false},"External ID":{"value":""},"Footnotes":{"value":"\u003col\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eOur analysis is part of an ongoing effort to recalibrate our perspective and modeling on mobility, taking into consideration both COVID-19-crisis and long-term trends.

To determine the full impact of the pandemic on this sector, as well as on future developments, we examined micromobility over three time horizons (Exhibit 1):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eShort term.\u003c/em\u003e What effect is the global lockdown having on micromobility now?\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eMedium term.\u003c/em\u003e Will we see a complete recovery, and what will the next normal look like?\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eLong term.\u003c/em\u003e What effects will the pandemic have on our 2030 market modeling?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n[[Exhibit 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eThis article is part of a series on the future of mobility after the COVID-19 crisis.[[footnote 1]]\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Ceros covid]]\n\u003ch2\u003eShort term: Spiked valuations and more bicycle lanes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn our short-term analysis, we examined the impact of the global pandemic on micromobility by examining the response of the industry itself, consumers, and cities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMicromobility-service providers are struggling\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe global lockdown is profoundly affecting service-provider valuations, workers employed in the sector, and the speed of industry consolidation. For example, the valuation of one company operating a worldwide network of e-bikes and e-scooters recently dropped by a reported 79 percent. Another provider halted operations in six US cities and all of its European markets, laying off 30 percent of its workforce. A third company cut working hours for 60 percent of its staff while supplying a streamlined fleet of its e-scooters to healthcare workers in Germany. The lockdown has also accelerated industry-consolidation moves. For example, a micromobility company recently acquired the e-bicycle and e-scooter business of a major ride-hailing company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eConsumer behavior is shifting rapidly\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response to measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic, such as shelter-at-home orders, local travel preferences are quickly changing. One example is the preference for longer trips. According to a US micromobility company that rents e-scooters, average trip distances have grown 26 percent since the start of the pandemic, with rides in some cities, such as Detroit, increasing by up to 60 percent. At a more detailed level, some cities are also experiencing a shift in consumer use cases. For instance, in San Francisco, the lockdown has caused a pronounced shift toward runs to the pharmacy and trips to restaurants to pick up food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCities are offering greater support for biking\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorldwide, the lockdown has driven new citywide policies. One major result is an increased focus on bicycle lanes. Consider the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eMilan has announced that 35 kilometers of streets previously used by cars will be transitioned to walking and cycling lanes after the lockdown is lifted.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eParis will convert 50 kilometers of lanes usually reserved for cars to bicycle lanes.

Based on an analysis of Apple iPhone data, the number of passenger-kilometers traveled by private and shared micromobility vehicles has decreased by an estimated 60 to 70 percent in Europe and the United States. Interestingly, the same data source already shows a U-shape recovery; extrapolating this trend indicates a recovery to precrisis levels of travel by 2021\u0026ndash;22.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo determine if and when micromobility would recover, we conducted a global consumer survey in May 2020. It included more than 7,000 respondents from seven global markets\u0026mdash;China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Our goal was to investigate consumer mobility behaviors and expectations before, during, and after the crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to our consumer survey, the use of micromobility might increase. It showed that the number of respondents willing to use micromobility in the next normal on a regular basis will increase by 9 percent for private micromobility and by 12 percent for shared micromobility compared to precrisis levels. Given these trends, we believe that private- and shared-micromobility solutions will experience a complete recovery in the number of passenger-kilometers traveled, with no significant drop from precrisis levels. We also believe that mobility in general will fully return to precrisis levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSome consumer priorities and usage patterns are changing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the industry itself will persevere, micromobility will undoubtedly look different after the crisis as it enters the next normal. Take consumer behavior, for instance. Prior to the pandemic, our consumer surveys revealed that the main pain point felt by regular users of shared micromobility was the time to destination. Now, it is the risk of infection (Exhibit 2).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 2]]\n\u003cp\u003eWhen asked in our May 2020 survey about measures that would increase the consumer likelihood of using shared-micromobility services, 47 percent of respondents cited regular disinfection of equipment,\n43 percent said physical distancing from the previous or next user, and 31 percent said user-health checks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile consumer concerns are changing, ridership preferences by age will likely remain static. In private micromobility, we expect to see a similar split across all age groups, precrisis and postcrisis (Exhibit 3).\nCurrently, about half of all shared-micromobility users are younger than 34, with the fewest users older than 55. Based on our consumer surveys, we do not anticipate a change of this ratio in the postpandemic era.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 3]]\n\u003ch3\u003eMobility patterns will likely change\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs seen during the COVID-19 crisis, average trip distances might increase, since people will use micromobility solutions more often when commuting. In our 2019 global ACES[[footnote 2]] consumer \u003ca href=\"/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/aces-2019-survey-can-established-auto-manufacturers-meet-customer-expectations-for-aces\"\u003esurvey\u003c/a\u003e, less than 20 percent of all shared-micromobility trips typically involved commuting. However, this survey also indicated that more than 70 percent of respondents would consider buying a private e-scooter for everyday commutes to work or school. This shift could boost private ownership in the e-scooter market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eIndustry consolidation will continue to accelerate\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith drastic decreases in ridership and revenue, shared-micromobility providers find themselves in a more precarious position\u0026mdash;and this could continue the accelerated consolidation of companies. In turn, greater acceleration could improve the business case for micromobility providers and increase profitability, given the synergies and scale-efficiency improvements that occur when buying larger volumes of vehicles, processing more payment transactions, and capturing greater back-office scale effects, along with a higher number of insurance fees. Furthermore, cities may reduce their permit fees to support micromobility as an alternative to private-car ownership after the COVID-19 crisis. For example, our analysis shows that the profitability of shared e-scooters could increase by up to five percentage points in the next normal (Exhibit 4).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 4]]\n\u003ch2\u003eLong term: More micromobility travel in the next normal\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe believe that micromobility will emerge intact and thrive in the long term. Indeed, our estimates for 2030 predict a boost of 5 to 10 percent in the number of passenger-kilometers traveled compared with our base case. This increase will come from several trends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, according to our consumer survey, people are now more willing to regularly use micromobility; in addition, average trip distances could increase, as observed during the COVID-19 crisis, leading to a higher revenue per trip. What\u0026rsquo;s more, higher awareness about personal hygiene and physical distancing might encourage consumers to use micromobility, rather than public transportation, for short trips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther trends relate to private-car usage. This form of transport could increase in cities in the next normal as people practice physical distancing to prevent transmission of COVID-19. Overall, private cars are seen as a safer mode of travel, especially when compared with public transit. As noted earlier, cities might enact measures to deincentivize and regulate private-car ownership, such as instituting higher parking fees, taxes, and tolls. They might also invest more in biking infrastructure or even repurpose whole streets to incentivize micromobility use. Furthermore, following the example of Italy, the industry could lower up-front costs for consumers by establishing purchasing premiums for bicycles, e-scooters, and mopeds. They may also enact mileage allowances for those using micromobility for commuting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, consumers could become more aware of the value of sustainable and noise-reducing transportation modes after experiencing them during lockdowns. Micromobility might thus emerge as a leading option for riders who want to protect the environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe global pandemic has transformed the way people think about travel, including micromobility.

The crisis has given automotive OEMs, suppliers, and other mobility players a new revenue and profit mandate: develop a sustainable business strategy that aligns with the realities of the next normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo help both incumbents and new businesses achieve this vision, we recently reviewed the \u003ca href=\"/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/start-me-up-where-mobility-investments-are-going\"\u003elandscape for mobility start-up and investment\u003c/a\u003e. In addition to looking at the amounts invested by and into specific companies, we identified the technologies that attracted the most funding, focusing on 17 critical categories related to \u003ca href=\"/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-mobility-is-at-our-doorstep\"\u003eautomation, connectivity, electrification, and smart mobility (ACES)\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTo gain a competitive edge, invest wisely\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the global pandemic, mobility players cannot ignore ACES-related developments if they wish to achieve a competitive edge over the next decade. (See sidebar, \u0026ldquo;Understanding the ACES trends,\u0026rdquo; for more information on recent technological advances). Even though the current economic landscape has increased financial pressures on mobility players, ACES technologies will continue to evolve and disrupt the \u003ca href=\"/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/reimagining-the-auto-industrys-future-its-now-or-never\"\u003eautomotive landscape\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Sidebar 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eWhile all the areas of ACES remain in play, the pandemic has introduced major uncertainties that could complicate technology investment. As our consumer surveys showed, business and leisure travel around the globe has dropped significantly. Moreover, consumers now consider shared modes of transport, such as ride services or subways, less safe than private modes. Such changes could have a lasting impact on transportation preferences and patterns, even after the pandemic abates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo ensure their future success in this changing environment, company leaders must take two steps. First, they must review potential ACES investment themes and identify the most promising ones, since it would be impossible for a single player to pursue all trends. (When it comes to ACES, the old gambler\u0026rsquo;s line about knowing when to hold or fold is appropriate.) Second, companies must create a plan that supports their selected investment priorities. It should describe the specific technologies or assets that merit investment and how the company will spend money to achieve the desired capabilities. The \u0026ldquo;how\u0026rdquo; part raises some strategic questions, such as whether companies should pursue ACES trends in-house, strike a partnership, or go the M\u0026amp;A route.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe continuing relevance of ACES\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince 2010, investors have poured nearly $330 billion into more than 2,000 mobility companies focused on ACES, with over $80 billion of this amount invested since the beginning of 2019 alone (Exhibit 1). About two-thirds of the total investment, or $206 billion, went to autonomous-vehicle (AV) technologies and smart mobility. A lower amount\u0026mdash;about $123 billion\u0026mdash;went to connectivity and electric vehicles (EVs), suggesting that companies prefer to develop these technologies in-house, rather than by pursuing inorganic growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 1]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eRecent investments have flattened.\u003c/em\u003e After a decade of steady growth in average annual investments in mobility companies, our analysis reveals an overall flattening of specific expenditures for the first time. The drop has been particularly intense in e-hailing and infotainment. (The former drove the early market but has recently seen an investment decline.) Meanwhile, investments in operational technologies remain small but continue to increase, particularly for car sharing, charging stations, and battery technologies, with a total of $29 billion invested since 2010. It is important to note that this trend was under way well before the pandemic.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[MostPopularArticles 5]]\n\u003cp\u003eOur analysis also reveals an acceleration of patent-filing activity across all four ACES technologies, suggesting a greater emphasis on in-house development and a move toward operationalizing prior investments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTechnology investments during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u003c/em\u003eInvestment in future-mobility technologies has continued throughout the pandemic. For example, a US automaker reached an agreement with another auto company in the spring of 2020 to develop new EVs, using the second brand\u0026rsquo;s battery technologies. Later that year, a commercial-vehicle manufacturer announced partnerships with two technology companies to develop AVs. According to our analysis, investment in mobility technologies totaled $39 billion through October 2020, suggesting that total spending for the year will likely be similar to the $51 billion seen in 2019. Overall technology investments have been decelerating in recent years, well before the pandemic increased economic pressures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOutsiders continue to outspend incumbents.\u003c/em\u003e Our analysis reveals that nonincumbents have made over 90 percent of investments in future-mobility companies since 2010, with 65 percent coming from venture-capital and private-equity (VC/PE) companies and 28 percent from tech players (Exhibit 2). Traditional automotive companies only accounted for 7 percent, or roughly $20 billion to $25 billion, of the total invested.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 2]]\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough auto incumbents accounted for only a small portion of investment in future-mobility companies, they have allocated more than $200 billion to develop ACES technologies in-house since 2014. About 80 percent of the total went to electrification. The high in-house investment suggests that many incumbents are more interested in building in-house capabilities than pursuing external partnerships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA more detailed, quarterly view of investments between 2014 and 2020 reveals that, with the exception of one quarter in 2017, VC/PE firms have consistently outspent their peers when it comes to investing in mobility companies (Exhibit 3). Their investment peaked at about $4.6 billion in the second quarter of 2017 and subsequently fell to a rather constant level of $2 billion to $3 billion per quarter. Meanwhile, investment by hardware-tech companies dropped significantly between 2018 and 2019 but recovered to nearly $1 billion in 2020. Investment by software-tech companies has steadily declined from a high of $1.3 billion in 2017. Finally, investment by auto brands reached over $400 million in 2015 but has since dropped to about $100 to $200 million per quarter.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 3]]\n\u003ch3\u003eThe core technologies fueling an investment race\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring our analysis of investment in mobility companies, we broke each ACES trend into company clusters. For instance, automation includes clusters for semiconductors and components of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), among other clusters. There were 20 clusters overall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur analysis reveals that companies have poured the largest sums into the e-hailing cluster over the past decade, with the $83 billion invested representing over 80 percent of all smart-mobility investments. The next most popular clusters included semiconductors ($51 billion) and ADAS components ($36 billion). Together, e-hailing, semiconductors, and ADAS components account for over half of all ACES investments (Exhibit 4).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 4]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePatent activity varies across ACES trends. \u003c/em\u003eAs Exhibit 4 also shows, companies have filed over 60,000 patents in ACES since 2010, with more than 80 percent targeting AVs and EVs. Companies have filed the most patents for ADAS components (about 9,000), semiconductors (5,000), EVs (10,000), batteries (7,000), and charging solutions (7,000). Patent activity in smart mobility is negligible, which suggests that business models and customer scaling\u0026mdash;rather than technology\u0026mdash;drives this pillar of ACES. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eLarge investment deals are significant. \u003c/em\u003eThe preponderance of investment in ADAS components, e-hailing services, and semiconductors is mostly a result of large investment deals. (More than 50 percent of total investment in these areas\u0026mdash;about $170 billion\u0026mdash;comes from around 1 percent of all transactions.) Investment flattened from 2018 through 2020 largely because investment in ADAS, e-hailing, and semiconductors decelerated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eInvestment is shifting among ACES trends.\u003c/em\u003e In other developments, investment in autonomous driving peaked in 2017 and then dropped significantly (Exhibit 5). Interest has been rising since mid-2019, however. Connectivity investments also peaked in 2017 and then lost traction.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 5]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNew avenues are emerging for growth in autonomous vehicles and smart mobility. \u003c/em\u003eWhile overall investment growth has flattened, some company clusters that had previously attracted relatively little interest have recently gained traction. When looking at investments from 2018 onward, compared with the period from 2014 to 2017, the most dramatic increases have occurred in companies involved with AV integration (a fourfold increase), AV software (threefold), micromobility (fourfold), and car sharing (seven- to eightfold).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Disruptor1UP dis1]]\n\u003cp\u003eIn smart mobility, companies outside of e-hailing are increasingly attracting investors. Meanwhile, investment in e-hailing services has slowed slightly, which might suggest that this mobility vertical has reached investor saturation. Investment in shared micromobility and car sharing has risen. The largest investments are going to asset-free-platform business models, primarily peer-to-peer (P2P) car-sharing platforms that connect private car owners with car-sharing users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, the mobility market appears ready to enter a new stage of operationalization and commercialization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMapping investment to crucial technologies\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe estimated that securing a strong position across all four ACES areas would cost a single player more than $70 billion through 2030. It is doubtful any individual company could shoulder this level of investment by itself. Setting the right technology focus is crucial and requires a detailed understanding of the technologies underlying the ACES trends.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Pullquote 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eTo assist companies, we investigated patent and investment activities by underlying technology\u0026mdash;an analysis that goes beyond market trends and company-level specifics. We first examined over 2,000 mobility businesses as outlined before and then mapped nearly 1,000 of them into one of the 20 company clusters we had previously identified. This mapping allowed us to identify 17 specific underlying technologies tied to investment and patent-filing activities. About half of the companies in our sample developed such technologies, with total funding exceeding $100 billion (Exhibit 6). This amount is nearly a third of the total $330 billion invested in ACES trends.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 6]]\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to our analysis, the underlying ACES technologies that attract investment are mostly related to autonomous driving, connectivity, and electrification. For AVs, the main investments focus on radar and camera technologies (about $23 billion), with about $1.4 billion going to light detection and ranging (Lidar). In connectivity, vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-everything (V2I/V2X) communication solutions attracted approximately $18 billion in spending. In electrification, $21 billion went to lithium-ion battery technology. Companies investing in the smart-mobility cluster make limited investments in technology, instead channeling funds to build the future customer base.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Disruptor1UP dis2]]\n\u003ch3\u003eSmaller, targeted investments in underlying technologies\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we looked at investments from a technology angle, rather than a company angle, some differences emerged. For instance, investments in shared-mobility companies tend to be larger, since they often focus on gaining scale and building the customer base. Technology investments may be lower in value because they often go to smaller players with distinctive technologies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAccelerating investments in electrification and some autonomous-driving technologies\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTechnologies related to electrification saw the strongest acceleration in investment. This trend may be occurring because many OEMs and suppliers are trying to reach regulatory emissions targets. For autonomous driving, image-recognition technology saw 3.5-fold growth and trajectory planning saw fivefold growth. Other technologies, particularly radar and camera technology, augmented reality, and voice recognition, have experienced a deceleration in investment, resulting in an overall flattening of investment in ACES technologies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe investment plateau, combined with the increased patent activity across all four technology sectors, could indicate an industry shift toward making technology solutions operational, especially for the more established ones already used in premium vehicles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor mobility investors, the COVID-19 crisis has added a new layer of complexity to an already challenging situation. In this time of uncertainty, it is critical for all mobility stakeholders, including incumbents, tech giants, and investors, to understand where the market is moving and why.

Stretching back to 1940s Switzerland, the idea has expanded over time to include shared micromobility offerings, such as bicycles in the 1960s. The modern manifestation began about a decade ago when the first major ride-hailing player appeared, and the field has grown significantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Sidebar 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eIn recent years, new modes and services have emerged, such as pooled ridesharing with strangers, peer-to-peer car sharing (driving a stranger\u0026rsquo;s private car), and shared electric scooters, pointing to a sizable potential market in the mobility space. The next big things include autonomous taxis (so-called robo-taxis) and airborne varieties, which have seen a huge investment acceleration and traction in recent months. (For more on the segmentation of shared mobility, see sidebar \u0026ldquo;Shared mobility\u0026rsquo;s many modern faces.\u0026rdquo;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis article describes the various segments of the shared-mobility market and offers an assessment of today\u0026rsquo;s market and a perspective on its current state, with a particular focus on market size, investments, and consumer sentiment. We also preview our outlook for the future of the market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eUnderstanding the shared-mobility market today: Market size\u003c/h2\u003e\n[[Image 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eThe shared-mobility market (as defined in the sidebar) accounted for approximately $130 billion to $140 billion in global consumer spending in 2019 (Exhibit 1). Out of this, e-hailing accounted for the largest share, $120 billion to $130 billion, which is more than 90 percent of the total market. Taken together, car sharing and peer-to-peer car sharing account for less than 10 percent of this market, which reflects e-hailing\u0026rsquo;s higher convenience (that is, the customer is driven, can spend the time in the vehicle on other activities, and does not have to find a parking space).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 2]]\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the evolution of trip development over time, Exhibit 2 shows that e-hailing retained a clearly dominant role in the shared-mobility market from 2016 to 2019, showing massive growth over those four years (amount of trips tripled). Shared micromobility shows an even stronger evolution\u0026mdash;while electric-scooter sharing did not play a major role before 2017, it accelerated in 2018 and 2019 (from fewer than 1 million trips until 2017 to greater than 160 million trips in 2019, when looking at the largest players). Our model shows micromobility could reach a consumer-spending potential of $300 billion to $500 billion globally by 2030 (combining shared and private micromobility), thus becoming three to four times larger than today\u0026rsquo;s global e-hailing market. This amount could grow even higher as the pandemic winds down and normal activities resume.[[Footnote 4]]\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 3]]\n\u003ch2\u003eUnderstanding the shared-mobility market today: Investments\u003c/h2\u003e\n[[Pullquote 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eSince 2010, more than $100 billion has been \u003ca href=\"/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/mobilitys-future-an-investment-reality-check\"\u003einvested in shared-mobility companies\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;(Exhibit 3). Looking deeper into types of investors, it\u0026rsquo;s not the automotive players that are investing in shared-mobility companies. Instead, around 72 percent of the total amount of disclosed investment since 2010 has come from venture capital and private-equity players, suggesting a bet on the future rather than on established and already sustainable business models. Tech players are second at approximately 21 percent, while automotive-company investments amount to approximately 4 percent. One reason for the traditional automotive industry\u0026rsquo;s lackluster showing could involve shared mobility\u0026rsquo;s potential for disrupting an automotive player\u0026rsquo;s core business. Some automotive OEMs have attempted to face the challenge through in-house initiatives rather than investments in external, new start-ups. This displays a mindset shift from selling vehicles to providing shared-mobility services, while the latter may even cannibalize OEMs\u0026rsquo; core business of selling cars to private individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 4]]\n[[MostPopularArticles 5]]\n\u003cp\u003eThe e-hailing market accounts for more than $95 billion in investments; roughly half of all e-hailing investments have focused on the three largest global players. The core e-hailing business model seeks to gain (asset-free) access to drivers and customers rather than building fleets and operating vehicles, which seems to be attractive for investors. However, for investors it\u0026rsquo;s a bet on the future. Robo-taxis and shuttles could become a game changer in the e-hailing market (due to expected lower operating cost compared to driver-based services); investors are waiting for industry players to commercialize autonomous-driving technology and become profitable at a large scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shared-micromobility market keeps growing and shows a high degree of investment acceleration. While shared electric scooters have entered markets at large scale as recently as 2017, shared-micromobility players have already attracted funding investments of more than $9 billion, putting that segment second behind e-hailing players. This reflects the accelerated uptake in shared-micromobility trips as outlined in the section on market size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe investments in the car-sharing market, at approximately $3 billion, are small compared with investments in e-hailing. On the one hand, some automotive OEMs develop car-sharing services in-house and leverage the opportunity to bring their own vehicles into the fleet at lower price points, which gives advantages in operating costs to start-ups. On the other hand, the lower investments reflect the market developments as outlined in the previous section. While the number of car-sharing trips remained relatively small, e-hailing rides nearly tripled. Likewise, the number of electric-scooter rides increased exponentially, indicating that the scale-up of asset-light businesses, such as those that serve micromobility and e-hailing, require much lower investments compared with asset-heavy businesses, such as car sharing. It also points to some consumer pain points and challenges in the car-sharing service that e-hailing can solve. These include driving a personal vehicle in congested traffic, locating and walking to the vehicle, and finding a parking spot at the destination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have seen the most rapid acceleration of investment in advanced air mobility, especially flying taxis, displaying an exponential rise over the past two to three years\u0026mdash;with more than $8 billion total invested (as of June 2021). In addition, this capital is now more concentrated among a few players, which may give those players the financial ability to make advanced air mobility a reality in the next decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome major shared-mobility players have even overtaken traditional automotive companies in terms of their valuations. The global leaders in the e-hailing market have the highest valuations by far, keeping up with the largest automotive OEMs and even exceeding the market capitalizations of long-established automotive OEMs in Germany. Valuations of shared-micromobility players are significantly lower today but showed strong acceleration, with some even gaining unicorn status in only a few years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eUnderstanding the shared-mobility market today: Consumers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrivate vehicles remain the most popular mode of transport in almost every country (Exhibit 4). Globally, 67 percent of survey respondents said they use their private vehicles frequently (that is, at least once a week), whereas 38 percent said they used public transportation frequently. Car sharing is the least used mode on average by consumers today, which reflects the lower trip numbers. E-hailing is the most popular for consumers in Brazil, China, and the United States\u0026mdash;in China, 90 percent of consumers stated that they use e-hailing services at least once per week.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 5]]\n\u003cp\u003eSurvey respondents said that their main reason for using shared mobility is convenience (Exhibit 5). This reflects today\u0026rsquo;s dominance of e-hailing over other shared-mobility modes. The most important features of shared-mobility services for consumers are safety (which may reflect the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our consumer survey at the end of 2020), a competitive price, and availability. The latter, especially, might be an important factor in shared mobility\u0026rsquo;s ability to replace private-car ownership in the long term. Notably, availability is the most important feature for German consumers.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 6]]\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to commuting, which is the most important mobility use case, private vehicles represent the overall preferred mode, especially in the United States. This preference is comparably low in China\u0026mdash;most likely due to the uneven distribution of cars. But if all transportation modes were available, around 33 percent of Chinese respondents would see shared mobility as the preferred transportation mode for commuting, with the use of private vehicles in second place.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Disruptor1UP dis1]]\n\u003cp\u003eWhen considering future mobility modes, respondents are open to robo-taxis, with more than half of them interested in trading in their car in the future, while 7 percent of consumers express they would even pay a premium compared with owning a car. Brazilian and Chinese respondents expressed the greatest likelihood of switching to robo-taxis and shuttles in the future. Exhibit 6 shows an illustrative outcome of our proprietary mobility market models for a scenario in which autonomous technology becomes available and affordable by the middle of this decade and in which cities are incentivizing new modes of mobility.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 7]]\n[[Pullquote 2]]\n\u003cp\u003eMainly motivated by arriving at their destination more quickly, consumers are also interested in using flying taxis. A detailed overview of our advanced air mobility consumer survey can be found in a separate article.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen new mobility modes do arise (for example, robo-taxis or flying taxis), we expect the market potential of other modes to decrease and shift or at least remain stable through 2030. This will depend on regulatory developments (for example, cities deincentivizing or restricting private-car ownership), technology developments (for example, autonomous-driving readiness), and consumer adoption.\u003c/p\u003e"},"Link4":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link5":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link3":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link2":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link1":{"value":{"href":""}},"Related Articles":"{96F0B2D0-46F7-4857-9FAB-5401C47DFF51}|{47090C52-47B0-4409-8AB7-E1753FE5C6C7}|{B2202782-F2B1-4696-B98F-17CABAE2E815}","Ceros Render Mode":null,"Ceros Background Color":null,"Appendix PDF":{"value":null},"Video Player Id":{"value":""},"Video Id":{"value":""},"Full Report PDF":{"value":null},"Article PDF":{"value":{"src":"/~/media/mckinsey/industries/automotive and assembly/our insights/shared mobility where it stands where its headed/shared-mobility-where-it-stands-where-its-headed.pdf","name":"Shared-mobility-Where-it-stands-where-its-headed","displayName":"Shared-mobility-Where-it-stands-where-its-headed","title":"Shared mobility: Where it stands, where it's headed","keywords":"","description":"","extension":"pdf","mimeType":"application/pdf","size":"1515120","pageCount":"11","thumbnailImageSrc":"/~/media/mckinsey/industries/automotive and assembly/our insights/shared mobility where it stands where its headed/shared-mobility-where-it-stands-where-its-headed_thumbnail.jpeg"}},"Hide Hero":{"value":false},"Has Special Report":{"value":false},"Hero Image Top Offset":{"value":""},"Executive Summary PDF":{"value":null},"Briefing Note PDF":{"value":null},"Research Preview PDF":{"value":null},"Discussion Papers PDF":{"value":null},"Call to Action for E-mail":{"value":"Look toward the future"},"Show Social Share Footer":{"value":false},"IsFullScreenInteractive":{"value":false},"EnableArticleComponents":{"value":false},"InteractiveToUse":null,"Five Fifty Related Items":{"value":[]},"Related Articles Dek":{"value":""},"Five Fifty Branding Dek":{"value":""},"CTA Links":{"value":[]},"Related Articles Title":{"value":""},"Five Fifty Branding Title":{"value":""},"External Link Thumbnail":{"value":{}},"Five-Fifty article background color":{"value":""},"Last Sync By":{"value":"sitecore\\pooja_yadav"},"Last Sync Timestamp":{"value":"2021-08-13T06:05:41Z"},"Standard Image":{"value":{"src":"/~/media/mckinsey/industries/automotive and assembly/our insights/shared mobility where it stands where its headed/png_mck-tickettoride-hero_1536x1536.png","alt":"Shared mobility: Where it stands, where it's headed","width":"1536","height":"1536","Description":""}},"Display Date":{"value":"2021-08-11T00:00:00Z"},"SEO Description":{"value":""},"Description":{"value":"Having weathered a pandemic, regulatory whiplash, and a host of other hurdles, shared mobility endures.

mobility changing\u0026mdash;for the better. While challenges to the electrification of the vehicle parc persist, opportunities worth fighting for also lay ahead. This is particularly evident in cities, where emissions, congestion, and safety constitute major issues today. If the status quo continues, mobility problems will intensify as population and GDP growth drive increased car ownership and vehicle miles traveled. In response, the mobility industry is unleashing a dazzling array of innovations designed for urban roads, such as mobility-as-a-service, advanced traffic management and parking systems, freight-sharing solutions, and new transportation concepts on two or three wheels.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Sidebar authors]]\n\u003cp\u003eThe current opportunity to transform the way we move fundamentally results from changes in three main areas: regulation, consumer behavior, and technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRegulation. \u003c/strong\u003eGovernments and cities have introduced regulations and incentives to \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/the-futures-of-mobility-how-cities-can-benefit\"\u003eaccelerate the shift to sustainable mobility\u003c/a\u003e. Regulators worldwide are defining more stringent emissions targets. The European Union presented its \u0026ldquo;Fit for 55\u0026rdquo; program, which seeks to align climate, energy, land use, transport, and taxation policies to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, and the Biden administration introduced a 50 percent electric vehicle (EV) target for 2030. Beyond such mandates, most governments are also offering EV subsidies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCities are working to reduce private vehicle use and congestion by offering greater support for alternative mobility modes like bicycles. Paris announced it will invest more than $300 million to update its bicycle network and convert 50 kilometers of car lanes into bicycle lanes. Many urban areas are also implementing access regulations for cars. In fact, over 150 cities in Europe have already created access regulations for low emissions and pollution emergencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[MostPopularArticles 5]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConsumer behavior. \u003c/strong\u003eConsumer behavior and awareness are changing as more people accept alternative and sustainable mobility modes. Inner city trips with shared bicycles and e-scooters have risen 60 percent year-over-year and the latest McKinsey consumer survey suggests average bicycle use (shared and private) may increase more than 10 percent in the post-pandemic world compared with pre-pandemic levels (See also \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-micromobility-ridership-and-revenue-after-a-crisis\"\u003eThe future of micromobility: Ridership and revenue after a crisis\u003c/a\u003e,\u0026rdquo; July 2020). In addition, consumers are becoming more open to shared mobility options. More than 20 percent of Germans surveyed say they already use ride-pooling services (6 percent do so at least once per week), which can help reduce vehicle miles traveled and emissions (See also \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/shared-mobility-where-it-stands-where-its-headed\"\u003eShared mobility: Where it stands, where it\u0026rsquo;s headed\u003c/a\u003e,\u0026rdquo; August 2021).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTechnology. \u003c/strong\u003eIndustry players are accelerating the speed of automotive technology innovation as they develop new concepts of electric, connected, autonomous, and shared mobility. The industry has attracted more than $400 billion in investments over the last decade\u0026mdash;with about $100 billion of that coming since the beginning of 2020. All this money targets companies and start-ups working on electrifying mobility, connecting vehicles, and autonomous driving technology (See also \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/mobilitys-future-an-investment-reality-check\"\u003eMobility\u0026rsquo;s future: An investment reality check\u003c/a\u003e,\u0026rdquo; April 2021). Such technology innovations will help reduce EV costs and make electric shared mobility a real alternative to owning a car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElectrification will play an important role in the transformation of the mobility industry and presents major opportunities in all vehicle segments, although the pace and extent of change will differ. To ensure the fast, widespread adoption of electric mobility, launching new EVs in the market is an important first step. In addition, the entire mobility ecosystem must work to make the transformation successful, from EV manufacturers and suppliers to financers, dealers, energy providers, and charging station operators\u0026mdash;to name only a few (Exhibit 1).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 1]]\n\u003ch2\u003eThe future of passenger vehicle powertrains is electric; the transformation is ongoing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tipping point in passenger EV adoption occurred in the second half of 2020, when EV sales and penetration accelerated in major markets despite the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Europe spearheaded this development, where EV adoption reached 8 percent due to policy mandates such as stricter emissions targets for OEMs and generous subsidies for consumers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2021, the discussions have centered on the end date for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle sales. New regulatory targets in the European Union and the United States now aim for an EV share of at least 50 percent by 2030, and several countries have announced accelerated timelines for ICE sales bans in 2030 or 2035. Some OEMs have stated their intentions to stop investing in new ICE platforms and models and many more have already defined a specific date to end ICE vehicle production. Consumer mindsets have also shifted toward sustainable mobility, with more than 45 percent of car customers considering buying an EV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the continued acceleration of electrification is putting significant pressure on OEMs, their supply chains, and the broader EV ecosystem to meet these targets. This is particularly obvious with respect to setting up the required charging infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBy 2035, the largest automotive markets will go electric\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegulatory pressure and the consumer pull toward EVs vary greatly by region. Europe is mainly a regulation-driven market with high subsidies, while in China consumer pull is very strong despite reduced incentives. In the United States, EV sales have grown slowly due to both limited regulatory pressure and consumer interest, although the regulator trend is set to change under the new administration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a global level, we expect EV (BEV, PHEV, and FCEV)[[Footnote 1]] adoption to reach 45 percent under currently expected regulatory targets. However, even this transformative EV growth outlook is far below what\u0026rsquo;s required to achieve net zero emissions. EVs would need to account for 75 percent of passenger car sales globally by 2030, which significantly outpaces the current course and speed of the industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe believe Europe\u0026mdash;as a regulatory-driven market with positive consumer demand trends\u0026mdash;will electrify the fastest and is expected to remain the global leader in electrification in terms of EV market share. In addition to the European Commission target, which requires around 60 percent EV sales by 2030, several countries have already announced an end to ICE sales by 2030. In line with this, seven OEM brands have committed to 100 percent EV sales by 2030 within the European Union. In the most likely accelerated scenario, consumer adoption will exceed regulatory targets and Europe will reach around 75 percent EV market share by 2030. The European Union announced a zero-emissions target for new cars by 2035.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Disruptor1Up dis1]]\n\u003cp\u003eChina will also continue to see strong growth in electrification and remain the largest EV market in absolute terms. Uptake results from strong consumer pull, despite low EV subsidies and no official end date for ICE sales. However, the government\u0026rsquo;s dual-credit policy has led to an increased EV share in OEMs\u0026rsquo; portfolios. Our adoption modeling yields a Chinese EV share above 70 percent for new car sales in 2030 in the accelerated scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the United States, the Biden administration announced a 50 percent electrification target for 2030, strong investments in charging infrastructure, and more stringent fleet emissions targets. EV uptake will result mainly from regulatory support in California and other states that follow its CARB ZEV regulation. US OEMs support electrification targets and have declared ICE bans by 2035, meaning the United States will follow Europe and China in EV uptake with a small delay; it is expected to exceed current regulatory targets and reach 65 percent EV sales by 2030 in the accelerated scenario (Exhibit 2).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 2]]\n\u003ch2\u003eThe e-mobility transformation will disrupt more than the automotive industry\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the European Union, achieving the accelerated scenario of around 75 percent EV sales by 2030 will have implications for the entire EV value chain and ecosystem. In parallel, the industry must decarbonize the full lifecycle of vehicles to get closer to a net-zero target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncumbent automotive suppliers need to shift production from ICE to EV components. Europe will have to build an estimated 24 new battery giga-factories to supply local passenger EV battery demand. With more than 70 million EVs on the road by 2030, the industry will need to install large numbers of public chargers and provide maintenance operations for them. Renewable electricity production needs to increase by 5 percent to meet EV charging demand. Finally, emissions from BEV production must decline, since BEVs currently have 80 percent higher emissions in production than ICE vehicles (Exhibit 3).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 3]]\n\u003ch3\u003eElectrification will cause a major shift in the entire automotive supply chain\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe transformation of the automotive industry toward electrification will disrupt the entire supply chain and create a significant shift in market size for automotive components. Critical components for electrification such as batteries and electric drives and for autonomous driving like light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors and radar sensors will likely make up about 52 percent of the total market size by 2030. Components only used in ICE vehicles such as conventional transmissions, engines, and fuel injection systems would see a significant decline to around 11 percent by 2030\u0026mdash;about half the size of 2019 levels. Such a drastic shift will force traditional component players to adapt quickly to offset decreasing revenue streams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scale of disruption will be significant: according to the Institute for Economic Research (Ifo) in Munich, more than 100,000 jobs will change in the German automotive industry by 2030. That is roughly five to ten times the scale of jobs compared with the phaseout of coal power that Germany announced for 2038 (Exhibit 4).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 4]]\n\u003ch3\u003eAnnounced EU battery production will likely stay just ahead of demand\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on announced buildup plans, we expect a 20-fold increase in battery production capacity in Europe to 965 GWh by 2030. Assuming the full capacity is built by 2030, Europe should meet expected demand of 874 GWh. BEV passenger cars and commercial vehicles will drive 90 percent of this battery demand. While on paper announced capacities seem to follow and match demand, in reality temporary implementation risks will likely occur given giga-factory production issues, typically slow yield ramp-ups, fragmentation of the supply chain, and large inflexible OEM contracts. Thus, in an accelerated EV adoption case, battery demand would come very close to exceeding announced supply in the medium term. In the next ten years, we expect the mining industry to slow down and other geopolitical and supply chain crises to pop up periodically, leading to some short-term price spikes in commodities like nickel and lithium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBattery cell production is moving physically closer to vehicle assembly plants. While ten years ago almost all cells were imported from Asia, regional production hubs exist today in Eastern Europe, for example. Furthermore, multiple plants will go onstream in key vehicle-producing countries like Germany, the United Kingdom, and France and in low-carbon-emitting environments such as Norway and Sweden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to incumbent battery cell players from Asia setting up locations in Europe, some entirely new companies are entering the space. One key development in battery sourcing involves the backward integration of OEMs from packs and modules up to cell production\u0026mdash;mostly in the form of joint ventures with cell manufacturers. OEM backward integration plans result from their growing battery cell demand, the desire for control and certainty of supply, and the ambition to keep a significant part of vehicle value creation inhouse. OEMs are also seeking areas for differentiation, with battery technology, durability, and performance seen as key evaluation criteria for BEVs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProduction of raw materials and battery components follow the localization trend of battery cell plants. However, there is a time lag and only some of the raw materials needed, which include nickel, cobalt, lithium, and graphite, are available for local sourcing in Europe. Companies must therefore compete globally to secure required volumes and do it sustainably in line with environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. While all four commodities must ramp up quickly, with potential price variation in the future, nickel will likely be the commodity under the most pressure in the short to medium term (Exhibit 5).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 5]]\n\u003ch3\u003eAcceleration in charging infrastructure buildup needed\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn line with EV uptake, the buildup of charging infrastructure needs to accelerate to avoid becoming a potential bottleneck and limiting consumer-driven EV adoption. Building charging infrastructure in sync with the EV fleet will be essential in the coming decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile first-generation EV buyers relied mainly on private charging (in 2020, 80 percent of EV buyers in Europe had access to private charging), the next generation will depend on public charging. More than 50 percent of Europeans will be living in multifamily homes without private charger access, and public chargers will ensure practicality of EVs for long-distance trips, which prospective EV buyers still consider a main concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLikewise, regulatory processes to install chargers in private homes require simplification and production capacity for wall boxes must increase. Production scale-up and simplified regulation (in terms of shortened permit and building times) are also necessary for public chargers, in addition to the creation of demand-based coverage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe estimate the industry needs to install more than 15,000 chargers per week by 2030 within the European Union. Simplified regulations are needed to facilitate charger siting, since it can currently take up to three years to obtain approval for grid extensions for a fast-charging station. Ensuring the EU-wide coverage of public charging is essential to avoid having chargers located only in profitable locations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEVs are poised to command on average more than 5 percent of electricity demand in 2030 in Europe. It will be important to reduce charging during peak load periods through \u0026ldquo;managed charging\u0026rdquo; by controlling charging time, duration, and intensity with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology as an enabler. In a scenario with appropriately managed charging devices in place as well as incentives to charge during nonpeak hours, much of the customer impact on the electric grid will be mitigated (Exhibit 6).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 6]]\n\u003ch3\u003eReaching net zero also means decarbonizing EV production\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a clear path to reducing CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e equivalent (CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003ee) emissions from passenger cars in operation. A recent International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) analysis stated that the shift from ICE to BEV would reduce total lifecycle CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003ee emissions by around 65 percent based on the current average energy mix in Europe and by 83 percent with entirely green electricity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the electricity supply evolves and charging with green energy for a larger fleet of EVs becomes feasible, materials and production will become the dominant sources of emissions in an EV\u0026rsquo;s lifecycle. Today an EV\u0026rsquo;s production generates an almost 80 percent higher emissions intensity compared with an ICE car, due mainly to the battery and the vehicle\u0026rsquo;s higher share of aluminum.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Disruptor1Up dis2]]\n\u003cp\u003eWhen aiming to reduce material emissions, two main issues matter:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIncreasing recycled content. \u003c/strong\u003eReplacing virgin/primary materials with recycled alternatives will save a large share of emissions associated with the initial generation of raw materials. Replacing 30 percent of primary material with recycled material can save 15 to 25 percent[[Footnote 2]] of production emissions. Recycled material use, however, comes with multiple challenges, including the reality that end-of-life (EOL) collection remains very immature, making it difficult to achieve an automotive-grade materials stream. Furthermore, multiple industries are interested in using recycled material to achieve their decarbonization targets, which will result in supply bottlenecks and the higher prices of several recycled materials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShifting to green raw materials. \u003c/strong\u003eUsing primary materials produced in a low/no-carbon process enables high-grade materials with low emissions footprints. Examples of this approach include inert anode aluminum smelting via hydroelectricity or steel produced through hydrogen-based direct reduced iron in an electric arc furnace (H2 DRI-EAF steel). Around 80 to 90 percent of today\u0026rsquo;s typical material emissions can be eliminated with 2030 technologies. The main approaches involve decarbonizing the raw material refining processes by using renewable electricity, for example, and decarbonizing the forming as well as other high-energy manufacturing processes, also via electrification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile a switch in electricity resources is simple, the shift from today\u0026rsquo;s processes to manufacturing routes that avoid CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003ee emissions altogether\u0026mdash;rather than capturing or gradually reducing them\u0026mdash;will require significant investments in plants and equipment. A predictable demand for green materials and long-term commitments between suppliers and buyers would help overcome this obstacle in the next decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA determined approach to decarbonizing and combining these methods could produce vehicles with 10 to 30 percent of today\u0026rsquo;s production emissions by 2030\u0026mdash;a challenging feat but necessary to fulfill the Green Deal aspiration. Nevertheless, decarbonizing the supply chain and achieving Scope 3 emissions reductions may cause vehicle costs to rise at a time when OEMs are trying to lower prices to boost consumer interest and achieve sustainable long-term margins (Exhibit 7).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 7]]\n\u003ch3\u003eA 55 percent transport emissions reduction target by 2030 versus 1990 requires more drastic measures\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrent regulation and targets are not sufficient if the road transport sector wants to fully contribute to the 55 percent CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003ee emissions reduction target by 2030 versus 1990 as required by the Fit for 55 program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, passenger cars have one advantage over other industries from a decarbonization point: The zero-emissions option (e.g., the BEV) is cheaper than the current alternative (ICE) from a total cost of ownership perspective in some countries today and by 2025 at the latest in countries without incentives. This is not the case in most other industries, where decarbonizing results in higher costs for both producers and consumers.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Sidebar 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, with the average car age at ten years in Europe, it will take time for EV sales to have an impact at the parc level. The current regulation on sales is therefore not sufficient to meet the goal of a 55 percent emissions reduction from 1990 levels by 2030.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing this gap will require further measures targeting CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003ee emissions of the vehicle parc. ICE vehicle kilometers traveled could be decreased by reducing private car kilometers, increasing shared mobility, and changing consumer perspectives on walking/biking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the most efficient lever is to accelerate the ICE parc turnover and remove highly polluting ICE vehicles from the fleet with, for example, \u0026ldquo;cash-for-clunkers\u0026rdquo; programs for old ICE cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother way to reduce CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003ee emissions from ICE vehicles is to increase the share of bio- and e-fuels as these have a low carbon footprint and are compatible with the existing ICE parc. However, the majority of bio- and e-fuels supply will be required to decarbonize marine/aviation and commercial road transport, for which only limited zero-emissions alternatives exist today (Exhibit 8).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 8]]\n\u003cp\u003eElectric vehicles are coming, and we are on the right track regarding decarbonizing the transport sector, though more actions need to be taken. It is an industry transformation taking place at unprecedented speed. It is also crossing industry borders, involving energy, infrastructure, mobility, and automotive players. While a major challenge, it represents a huge opportunity for incumbents and new players to take a leading role in creating new multi-billion industries and jobs. The key will be to couple sustainability with economic viability through innovative technology and properly guided mobility transformation. Based on its diverse mobility landscape, its focus on sustainability and its proven technology leadership, Europe could emerge as a role model for other regions globally.\u003c/p\u003e"},"Link4":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link5":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link3":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link2":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link1":{"value":{"href":""}},"Related Articles":[{"id":"98c74bed-1ec5-4158-a6e6-0c2cffb75691","url":"/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-micromobility-ridership-and-revenue-after-a-crisis","name":"The future of micromobility Ridership and revenue after a crisis","displayName":"The future of micromobility Ridership and revenue after a crisis","fields":{"Mobile Ready":{"value":true},"Exclude from RSS":{"value":false},"Exclude from ClientLink":{"value":false},"Apple News Article ID":{"value":""},"For Clients Only":{"value":false},"Source Publication":null,"Primary Destination":[],"Contributory Practice":"{535F1DB4-17F6-4C36-8CA8-B169A242F998}","Closer Tout Text":{"value":""},"Article Type":{"name":"Article","displayName":"Article","id":"{0ABBC29E-46EE-470B-A93B-C31F735E753A}","fields":{}},"Tout Text":{"value":""},"Thumbnail Image Mobile":{"value":{}},"Featured Image Mobile":{"value":{}},"Browse Image Mobile":{"value":{}},"Interactive Content":{"value":""},"Authors":"{5985E50C-459B-43EC-B9C8-C2B077EFBFC5}|{7E0D10EE-30D4-41BA-BA02-3B0648A6E1B1}|{9F30B94A-CDEC-4B78-AC88-C12C260E0C2F}","UseEnhancedAuthors":{"value":false},"Acknowledgements":{"value":""},"About The Authors":{"value":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"/our-people/kersten-heineke\"\u003eKersten Heineke\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e leads the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility and is a partner in McKinsey\u0026rsquo;s Frankfurt office, where \u003cstrong\u003eBenedikt Kloss\u003c/strong\u003e is an associate partner; \u003cstrong\u003eDarius Scurtu\u003c/strong\u003e is a knowledge analyst in the Munich office. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis article was edited by Belinda Yu, an assistant managing editor in the Atlanta office.\u003c/p\u003e"},"Hide ByLine":{"value":false},"External ID":{"value":""},"Footnotes":{"value":"\u003col\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eOur analysis is part of an ongoing effort to recalibrate our perspective and modeling on mobility, taking into consideration both COVID-19-crisis and long-term trends.

To determine the full impact of the pandemic on this sector, as well as on future developments, we examined micromobility over three time horizons (Exhibit 1):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eShort term.\u003c/em\u003e What effect is the global lockdown having on micromobility now?\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eMedium term.\u003c/em\u003e Will we see a complete recovery, and what will the next normal look like?\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eLong term.\u003c/em\u003e What effects will the pandemic have on our 2030 market modeling?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n[[Exhibit 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eThis article is part of a series on the future of mobility after the COVID-19 crisis.[[footnote 1]]\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Ceros covid]]\n\u003ch2\u003eShort term: Spiked valuations and more bicycle lanes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn our short-term analysis, we examined the impact of the global pandemic on micromobility by examining the response of the industry itself, consumers, and cities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMicromobility-service providers are struggling\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe global lockdown is profoundly affecting service-provider valuations, workers employed in the sector, and the speed of industry consolidation. For example, the valuation of one company operating a worldwide network of e-bikes and e-scooters recently dropped by a reported 79 percent. Another provider halted operations in six US cities and all of its European markets, laying off 30 percent of its workforce. A third company cut working hours for 60 percent of its staff while supplying a streamlined fleet of its e-scooters to healthcare workers in Germany. The lockdown has also accelerated industry-consolidation moves. For example, a micromobility company recently acquired the e-bicycle and e-scooter business of a major ride-hailing company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eConsumer behavior is shifting rapidly\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response to measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic, such as shelter-at-home orders, local travel preferences are quickly changing. One example is the preference for longer trips. According to a US micromobility company that rents e-scooters, average trip distances have grown 26 percent since the start of the pandemic, with rides in some cities, such as Detroit, increasing by up to 60 percent. At a more detailed level, some cities are also experiencing a shift in consumer use cases. For instance, in San Francisco, the lockdown has caused a pronounced shift toward runs to the pharmacy and trips to restaurants to pick up food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCities are offering greater support for biking\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorldwide, the lockdown has driven new citywide policies. One major result is an increased focus on bicycle lanes. Consider the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eMilan has announced that 35 kilometers of streets previously used by cars will be transitioned to walking and cycling lanes after the lockdown is lifted.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eParis will convert 50 kilometers of lanes usually reserved for cars to bicycle lanes.

Based on an analysis of Apple iPhone data, the number of passenger-kilometers traveled by private and shared micromobility vehicles has decreased by an estimated 60 to 70 percent in Europe and the United States. Interestingly, the same data source already shows a U-shape recovery; extrapolating this trend indicates a recovery to precrisis levels of travel by 2021\u0026ndash;22.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo determine if and when micromobility would recover, we conducted a global consumer survey in May 2020. It included more than 7,000 respondents from seven global markets\u0026mdash;China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Our goal was to investigate consumer mobility behaviors and expectations before, during, and after the crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to our consumer survey, the use of micromobility might increase. It showed that the number of respondents willing to use micromobility in the next normal on a regular basis will increase by 9 percent for private micromobility and by 12 percent for shared micromobility compared to precrisis levels. Given these trends, we believe that private- and shared-micromobility solutions will experience a complete recovery in the number of passenger-kilometers traveled, with no significant drop from precrisis levels. We also believe that mobility in general will fully return to precrisis levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSome consumer priorities and usage patterns are changing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the industry itself will persevere, micromobility will undoubtedly look different after the crisis as it enters the next normal. Take consumer behavior, for instance. Prior to the pandemic, our consumer surveys revealed that the main pain point felt by regular users of shared micromobility was the time to destination. Now, it is the risk of infection (Exhibit 2).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 2]]\n\u003cp\u003eWhen asked in our May 2020 survey about measures that would increase the consumer likelihood of using shared-micromobility services, 47 percent of respondents cited regular disinfection of equipment,\n43 percent said physical distancing from the previous or next user, and 31 percent said user-health checks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile consumer concerns are changing, ridership preferences by age will likely remain static. In private micromobility, we expect to see a similar split across all age groups, precrisis and postcrisis (Exhibit 3).\nCurrently, about half of all shared-micromobility users are younger than 34, with the fewest users older than 55. Based on our consumer surveys, we do not anticipate a change of this ratio in the postpandemic era.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 3]]\n\u003ch3\u003eMobility patterns will likely change\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs seen during the COVID-19 crisis, average trip distances might increase, since people will use micromobility solutions more often when commuting. In our 2019 global ACES[[footnote 2]] consumer \u003ca href=\"/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/aces-2019-survey-can-established-auto-manufacturers-meet-customer-expectations-for-aces\"\u003esurvey\u003c/a\u003e, less than 20 percent of all shared-micromobility trips typically involved commuting. However, this survey also indicated that more than 70 percent of respondents would consider buying a private e-scooter for everyday commutes to work or school. This shift could boost private ownership in the e-scooter market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eIndustry consolidation will continue to accelerate\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith drastic decreases in ridership and revenue, shared-micromobility providers find themselves in a more precarious position\u0026mdash;and this could continue the accelerated consolidation of companies. In turn, greater acceleration could improve the business case for micromobility providers and increase profitability, given the synergies and scale-efficiency improvements that occur when buying larger volumes of vehicles, processing more payment transactions, and capturing greater back-office scale effects, along with a higher number of insurance fees. Furthermore, cities may reduce their permit fees to support micromobility as an alternative to private-car ownership after the COVID-19 crisis. For example, our analysis shows that the profitability of shared e-scooters could increase by up to five percentage points in the next normal (Exhibit 4).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 4]]\n\u003ch2\u003eLong term: More micromobility travel in the next normal\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe believe that micromobility will emerge intact and thrive in the long term. Indeed, our estimates for 2030 predict a boost of 5 to 10 percent in the number of passenger-kilometers traveled compared with our base case. This increase will come from several trends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, according to our consumer survey, people are now more willing to regularly use micromobility; in addition, average trip distances could increase, as observed during the COVID-19 crisis, leading to a higher revenue per trip. What\u0026rsquo;s more, higher awareness about personal hygiene and physical distancing might encourage consumers to use micromobility, rather than public transportation, for short trips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther trends relate to private-car usage. This form of transport could increase in cities in the next normal as people practice physical distancing to prevent transmission of COVID-19. Overall, private cars are seen as a safer mode of travel, especially when compared with public transit. As noted earlier, cities might enact measures to deincentivize and regulate private-car ownership, such as instituting higher parking fees, taxes, and tolls. They might also invest more in biking infrastructure or even repurpose whole streets to incentivize micromobility use. Furthermore, following the example of Italy, the industry could lower up-front costs for consumers by establishing purchasing premiums for bicycles, e-scooters, and mopeds. They may also enact mileage allowances for those using micromobility for commuting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, consumers could become more aware of the value of sustainable and noise-reducing transportation modes after experiencing them during lockdowns. Micromobility might thus emerge as a leading option for riders who want to protect the environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe global pandemic has transformed the way people think about travel, including micromobility.

The crisis has given automotive OEMs, suppliers, and other mobility players a new revenue and profit mandate: develop a sustainable business strategy that aligns with the realities of the next normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo help both incumbents and new businesses achieve this vision, we recently reviewed the \u003ca href=\"/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/start-me-up-where-mobility-investments-are-going\"\u003elandscape for mobility start-up and investment\u003c/a\u003e. In addition to looking at the amounts invested by and into specific companies, we identified the technologies that attracted the most funding, focusing on 17 critical categories related to \u003ca href=\"/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-mobility-is-at-our-doorstep\"\u003eautomation, connectivity, electrification, and smart mobility (ACES)\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTo gain a competitive edge, invest wisely\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the global pandemic, mobility players cannot ignore ACES-related developments if they wish to achieve a competitive edge over the next decade. (See sidebar, \u0026ldquo;Understanding the ACES trends,\u0026rdquo; for more information on recent technological advances). Even though the current economic landscape has increased financial pressures on mobility players, ACES technologies will continue to evolve and disrupt the \u003ca href=\"/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/reimagining-the-auto-industrys-future-its-now-or-never\"\u003eautomotive landscape\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Sidebar 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eWhile all the areas of ACES remain in play, the pandemic has introduced major uncertainties that could complicate technology investment. As our consumer surveys showed, business and leisure travel around the globe has dropped significantly. Moreover, consumers now consider shared modes of transport, such as ride services or subways, less safe than private modes. Such changes could have a lasting impact on transportation preferences and patterns, even after the pandemic abates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo ensure their future success in this changing environment, company leaders must take two steps. First, they must review potential ACES investment themes and identify the most promising ones, since it would be impossible for a single player to pursue all trends. (When it comes to ACES, the old gambler\u0026rsquo;s line about knowing when to hold or fold is appropriate.) Second, companies must create a plan that supports their selected investment priorities. It should describe the specific technologies or assets that merit investment and how the company will spend money to achieve the desired capabilities. The \u0026ldquo;how\u0026rdquo; part raises some strategic questions, such as whether companies should pursue ACES trends in-house, strike a partnership, or go the M\u0026amp;A route.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe continuing relevance of ACES\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince 2010, investors have poured nearly $330 billion into more than 2,000 mobility companies focused on ACES, with over $80 billion of this amount invested since the beginning of 2019 alone (Exhibit 1). About two-thirds of the total investment, or $206 billion, went to autonomous-vehicle (AV) technologies and smart mobility. A lower amount\u0026mdash;about $123 billion\u0026mdash;went to connectivity and electric vehicles (EVs), suggesting that companies prefer to develop these technologies in-house, rather than by pursuing inorganic growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 1]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eRecent investments have flattened.\u003c/em\u003e After a decade of steady growth in average annual investments in mobility companies, our analysis reveals an overall flattening of specific expenditures for the first time. The drop has been particularly intense in e-hailing and infotainment. (The former drove the early market but has recently seen an investment decline.) Meanwhile, investments in operational technologies remain small but continue to increase, particularly for car sharing, charging stations, and battery technologies, with a total of $29 billion invested since 2010. It is important to note that this trend was under way well before the pandemic.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[MostPopularArticles 5]]\n\u003cp\u003eOur analysis also reveals an acceleration of patent-filing activity across all four ACES technologies, suggesting a greater emphasis on in-house development and a move toward operationalizing prior investments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTechnology investments during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u003c/em\u003eInvestment in future-mobility technologies has continued throughout the pandemic. For example, a US automaker reached an agreement with another auto company in the spring of 2020 to develop new EVs, using the second brand\u0026rsquo;s battery technologies. Later that year, a commercial-vehicle manufacturer announced partnerships with two technology companies to develop AVs. According to our analysis, investment in mobility technologies totaled $39 billion through October 2020, suggesting that total spending for the year will likely be similar to the $51 billion seen in 2019. Overall technology investments have been decelerating in recent years, well before the pandemic increased economic pressures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOutsiders continue to outspend incumbents.\u003c/em\u003e Our analysis reveals that nonincumbents have made over 90 percent of investments in future-mobility companies since 2010, with 65 percent coming from venture-capital and private-equity (VC/PE) companies and 28 percent from tech players (Exhibit 2). Traditional automotive companies only accounted for 7 percent, or roughly $20 billion to $25 billion, of the total invested.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 2]]\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough auto incumbents accounted for only a small portion of investment in future-mobility companies, they have allocated more than $200 billion to develop ACES technologies in-house since 2014. About 80 percent of the total went to electrification. The high in-house investment suggests that many incumbents are more interested in building in-house capabilities than pursuing external partnerships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA more detailed, quarterly view of investments between 2014 and 2020 reveals that, with the exception of one quarter in 2017, VC/PE firms have consistently outspent their peers when it comes to investing in mobility companies (Exhibit 3). Their investment peaked at about $4.6 billion in the second quarter of 2017 and subsequently fell to a rather constant level of $2 billion to $3 billion per quarter. Meanwhile, investment by hardware-tech companies dropped significantly between 2018 and 2019 but recovered to nearly $1 billion in 2020. Investment by software-tech companies has steadily declined from a high of $1.3 billion in 2017. Finally, investment by auto brands reached over $400 million in 2015 but has since dropped to about $100 to $200 million per quarter.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 3]]\n\u003ch3\u003eThe core technologies fueling an investment race\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring our analysis of investment in mobility companies, we broke each ACES trend into company clusters. For instance, automation includes clusters for semiconductors and components of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), among other clusters. There were 20 clusters overall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur analysis reveals that companies have poured the largest sums into the e-hailing cluster over the past decade, with the $83 billion invested representing over 80 percent of all smart-mobility investments. The next most popular clusters included semiconductors ($51 billion) and ADAS components ($36 billion). Together, e-hailing, semiconductors, and ADAS components account for over half of all ACES investments (Exhibit 4).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 4]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePatent activity varies across ACES trends. \u003c/em\u003eAs Exhibit 4 also shows, companies have filed over 60,000 patents in ACES since 2010, with more than 80 percent targeting AVs and EVs. Companies have filed the most patents for ADAS components (about 9,000), semiconductors (5,000), EVs (10,000), batteries (7,000), and charging solutions (7,000). Patent activity in smart mobility is negligible, which suggests that business models and customer scaling\u0026mdash;rather than technology\u0026mdash;drives this pillar of ACES. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eLarge investment deals are significant. \u003c/em\u003eThe preponderance of investment in ADAS components, e-hailing services, and semiconductors is mostly a result of large investment deals. (More than 50 percent of total investment in these areas\u0026mdash;about $170 billion\u0026mdash;comes from around 1 percent of all transactions.) Investment flattened from 2018 through 2020 largely because investment in ADAS, e-hailing, and semiconductors decelerated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eInvestment is shifting among ACES trends.\u003c/em\u003e In other developments, investment in autonomous driving peaked in 2017 and then dropped significantly (Exhibit 5). Interest has been rising since mid-2019, however. Connectivity investments also peaked in 2017 and then lost traction.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 5]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNew avenues are emerging for growth in autonomous vehicles and smart mobility. \u003c/em\u003eWhile overall investment growth has flattened, some company clusters that had previously attracted relatively little interest have recently gained traction. When looking at investments from 2018 onward, compared with the period from 2014 to 2017, the most dramatic increases have occurred in companies involved with AV integration (a fourfold increase), AV software (threefold), micromobility (fourfold), and car sharing (seven- to eightfold).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Disruptor1UP dis1]]\n\u003cp\u003eIn smart mobility, companies outside of e-hailing are increasingly attracting investors. Meanwhile, investment in e-hailing services has slowed slightly, which might suggest that this mobility vertical has reached investor saturation. Investment in shared micromobility and car sharing has risen. The largest investments are going to asset-free-platform business models, primarily peer-to-peer (P2P) car-sharing platforms that connect private car owners with car-sharing users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, the mobility market appears ready to enter a new stage of operationalization and commercialization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMapping investment to crucial technologies\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe estimated that securing a strong position across all four ACES areas would cost a single player more than $70 billion through 2030. It is doubtful any individual company could shoulder this level of investment by itself. Setting the right technology focus is crucial and requires a detailed understanding of the technologies underlying the ACES trends.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Pullquote 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eTo assist companies, we investigated patent and investment activities by underlying technology\u0026mdash;an analysis that goes beyond market trends and company-level specifics. We first examined over 2,000 mobility businesses as outlined before and then mapped nearly 1,000 of them into one of the 20 company clusters we had previously identified. This mapping allowed us to identify 17 specific underlying technologies tied to investment and patent-filing activities. About half of the companies in our sample developed such technologies, with total funding exceeding $100 billion (Exhibit 6). This amount is nearly a third of the total $330 billion invested in ACES trends.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 6]]\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to our analysis, the underlying ACES technologies that attract investment are mostly related to autonomous driving, connectivity, and electrification. For AVs, the main investments focus on radar and camera technologies (about $23 billion), with about $1.4 billion going to light detection and ranging (Lidar). In connectivity, vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-everything (V2I/V2X) communication solutions attracted approximately $18 billion in spending. In electrification, $21 billion went to lithium-ion battery technology. Companies investing in the smart-mobility cluster make limited investments in technology, instead channeling funds to build the future customer base.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Disruptor1UP dis2]]\n\u003ch3\u003eSmaller, targeted investments in underlying technologies\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we looked at investments from a technology angle, rather than a company angle, some differences emerged. For instance, investments in shared-mobility companies tend to be larger, since they often focus on gaining scale and building the customer base. Technology investments may be lower in value because they often go to smaller players with distinctive technologies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAccelerating investments in electrification and some autonomous-driving technologies\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTechnologies related to electrification saw the strongest acceleration in investment. This trend may be occurring because many OEMs and suppliers are trying to reach regulatory emissions targets. For autonomous driving, image-recognition technology saw 3.5-fold growth and trajectory planning saw fivefold growth. Other technologies, particularly radar and camera technology, augmented reality, and voice recognition, have experienced a deceleration in investment, resulting in an overall flattening of investment in ACES technologies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe investment plateau, combined with the increased patent activity across all four technology sectors, could indicate an industry shift toward making technology solutions operational, especially for the more established ones already used in premium vehicles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor mobility investors, the COVID-19 crisis has added a new layer of complexity to an already challenging situation. In this time of uncertainty, it is critical for all mobility stakeholders, including incumbents, tech giants, and investors, to understand where the market is moving and why.

Stretching back to 1940s Switzerland, the idea has expanded over time to include shared micromobility offerings, such as bicycles in the 1960s. The modern manifestation began about a decade ago when the first major ride-hailing player appeared, and the field has grown significantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Sidebar 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eIn recent years, new modes and services have emerged, such as pooled ridesharing with strangers, peer-to-peer car sharing (driving a stranger\u0026rsquo;s private car), and shared electric scooters, pointing to a sizable potential market in the mobility space. The next big things include autonomous taxis (so-called robo-taxis) and airborne varieties, which have seen a huge investment acceleration and traction in recent months. (For more on the segmentation of shared mobility, see sidebar \u0026ldquo;Shared mobility\u0026rsquo;s many modern faces.\u0026rdquo;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis article describes the various segments of the shared-mobility market and offers an assessment of today\u0026rsquo;s market and a perspective on its current state, with a particular focus on market size, investments, and consumer sentiment. We also preview our outlook for the future of the market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eUnderstanding the shared-mobility market today: Market size\u003c/h2\u003e\n[[Image 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eThe shared-mobility market (as defined in the sidebar) accounted for approximately $130 billion to $140 billion in global consumer spending in 2019 (Exhibit 1). Out of this, e-hailing accounted for the largest share, $120 billion to $130 billion, which is more than 90 percent of the total market. Taken together, car sharing and peer-to-peer car sharing account for less than 10 percent of this market, which reflects e-hailing\u0026rsquo;s higher convenience (that is, the customer is driven, can spend the time in the vehicle on other activities, and does not have to find a parking space).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 2]]\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the evolution of trip development over time, Exhibit 2 shows that e-hailing retained a clearly dominant role in the shared-mobility market from 2016 to 2019, showing massive growth over those four years (amount of trips tripled). Shared micromobility shows an even stronger evolution\u0026mdash;while electric-scooter sharing did not play a major role before 2017, it accelerated in 2018 and 2019 (from fewer than 1 million trips until 2017 to greater than 160 million trips in 2019, when looking at the largest players). Our model shows micromobility could reach a consumer-spending potential of $300 billion to $500 billion globally by 2030 (combining shared and private micromobility), thus becoming three to four times larger than today\u0026rsquo;s global e-hailing market. This amount could grow even higher as the pandemic winds down and normal activities resume.[[Footnote 4]]\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 3]]\n\u003ch2\u003eUnderstanding the shared-mobility market today: Investments\u003c/h2\u003e\n[[Pullquote 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eSince 2010, more than $100 billion has been \u003ca href=\"/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/mobilitys-future-an-investment-reality-check\"\u003einvested in shared-mobility companies\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;(Exhibit 3). Looking deeper into types of investors, it\u0026rsquo;s not the automotive players that are investing in shared-mobility companies. Instead, around 72 percent of the total amount of disclosed investment since 2010 has come from venture capital and private-equity players, suggesting a bet on the future rather than on established and already sustainable business models. Tech players are second at approximately 21 percent, while automotive-company investments amount to approximately 4 percent. One reason for the traditional automotive industry\u0026rsquo;s lackluster showing could involve shared mobility\u0026rsquo;s potential for disrupting an automotive player\u0026rsquo;s core business. Some automotive OEMs have attempted to face the challenge through in-house initiatives rather than investments in external, new start-ups. This displays a mindset shift from selling vehicles to providing shared-mobility services, while the latter may even cannibalize OEMs\u0026rsquo; core business of selling cars to private individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 4]]\n[[MostPopularArticles 5]]\n\u003cp\u003eThe e-hailing market accounts for more than $95 billion in investments; roughly half of all e-hailing investments have focused on the three largest global players. The core e-hailing business model seeks to gain (asset-free) access to drivers and customers rather than building fleets and operating vehicles, which seems to be attractive for investors. However, for investors it\u0026rsquo;s a bet on the future. Robo-taxis and shuttles could become a game changer in the e-hailing market (due to expected lower operating cost compared to driver-based services); investors are waiting for industry players to commercialize autonomous-driving technology and become profitable at a large scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shared-micromobility market keeps growing and shows a high degree of investment acceleration. While shared electric scooters have entered markets at large scale as recently as 2017, shared-micromobility players have already attracted funding investments of more than $9 billion, putting that segment second behind e-hailing players. This reflects the accelerated uptake in shared-micromobility trips as outlined in the section on market size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe investments in the car-sharing market, at approximately $3 billion, are small compared with investments in e-hailing. On the one hand, some automotive OEMs develop car-sharing services in-house and leverage the opportunity to bring their own vehicles into the fleet at lower price points, which gives advantages in operating costs to start-ups. On the other hand, the lower investments reflect the market developments as outlined in the previous section. While the number of car-sharing trips remained relatively small, e-hailing rides nearly tripled. Likewise, the number of electric-scooter rides increased exponentially, indicating that the scale-up of asset-light businesses, such as those that serve micromobility and e-hailing, require much lower investments compared with asset-heavy businesses, such as car sharing. It also points to some consumer pain points and challenges in the car-sharing service that e-hailing can solve. These include driving a personal vehicle in congested traffic, locating and walking to the vehicle, and finding a parking spot at the destination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have seen the most rapid acceleration of investment in advanced air mobility, especially flying taxis, displaying an exponential rise over the past two to three years\u0026mdash;with more than $8 billion total invested (as of June 2021). In addition, this capital is now more concentrated among a few players, which may give those players the financial ability to make advanced air mobility a reality in the next decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome major shared-mobility players have even overtaken traditional automotive companies in terms of their valuations. The global leaders in the e-hailing market have the highest valuations by far, keeping up with the largest automotive OEMs and even exceeding the market capitalizations of long-established automotive OEMs in Germany. Valuations of shared-micromobility players are significantly lower today but showed strong acceleration, with some even gaining unicorn status in only a few years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eUnderstanding the shared-mobility market today: Consumers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrivate vehicles remain the most popular mode of transport in almost every country (Exhibit 4). Globally, 67 percent of survey respondents said they use their private vehicles frequently (that is, at least once a week), whereas 38 percent said they used public transportation frequently. Car sharing is the least used mode on average by consumers today, which reflects the lower trip numbers. E-hailing is the most popular for consumers in Brazil, China, and the United States\u0026mdash;in China, 90 percent of consumers stated that they use e-hailing services at least once per week.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 5]]\n\u003cp\u003eSurvey respondents said that their main reason for using shared mobility is convenience (Exhibit 5). This reflects today\u0026rsquo;s dominance of e-hailing over other shared-mobility modes. The most important features of shared-mobility services for consumers are safety (which may reflect the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our consumer survey at the end of 2020), a competitive price, and availability. The latter, especially, might be an important factor in shared mobility\u0026rsquo;s ability to replace private-car ownership in the long term. Notably, availability is the most important feature for German consumers.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 6]]\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to commuting, which is the most important mobility use case, private vehicles represent the overall preferred mode, especially in the United States. This preference is comparably low in China\u0026mdash;most likely due to the uneven distribution of cars. But if all transportation modes were available, around 33 percent of Chinese respondents would see shared mobility as the preferred transportation mode for commuting, with the use of private vehicles in second place.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Disruptor1UP dis1]]\n\u003cp\u003eWhen considering future mobility modes, respondents are open to robo-taxis, with more than half of them interested in trading in their car in the future, while 7 percent of consumers express they would even pay a premium compared with owning a car. Brazilian and Chinese respondents expressed the greatest likelihood of switching to robo-taxis and shuttles in the future. Exhibit 6 shows an illustrative outcome of our proprietary mobility market models for a scenario in which autonomous technology becomes available and affordable by the middle of this decade and in which cities are incentivizing new modes of mobility.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 7]]\n[[Pullquote 2]]\n\u003cp\u003eMainly motivated by arriving at their destination more quickly, consumers are also interested in using flying taxis. A detailed overview of our advanced air mobility consumer survey can be found in a separate article.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen new mobility modes do arise (for example, robo-taxis or flying taxis), we expect the market potential of other modes to decrease and shift or at least remain stable through 2030. This will depend on regulatory developments (for example, cities deincentivizing or restricting private-car ownership), technology developments (for example, autonomous-driving readiness), and consumer adoption.\u003c/p\u003e"},"Link4":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link5":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link3":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link2":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link1":{"value":{"href":""}},"Related Articles":"{96F0B2D0-46F7-4857-9FAB-5401C47DFF51}|{47090C52-47B0-4409-8AB7-E1753FE5C6C7}|{B2202782-F2B1-4696-B98F-17CABAE2E815}","Ceros Render Mode":null,"Ceros Background Color":null,"Appendix PDF":{"value":null},"Video Player Id":{"value":""},"Video Id":{"value":""},"Full Report PDF":{"value":null},"Article PDF":{"value":{"src":"/~/media/mckinsey/industries/automotive and assembly/our insights/shared mobility where it stands where its headed/shared-mobility-where-it-stands-where-its-headed.pdf","name":"Shared-mobility-Where-it-stands-where-its-headed","displayName":"Shared-mobility-Where-it-stands-where-its-headed","title":"Shared mobility: Where it stands, where it's headed","keywords":"","description":"","extension":"pdf","mimeType":"application/pdf","size":"1515120","pageCount":"11","thumbnailImageSrc":"/~/media/mckinsey/industries/automotive and assembly/our insights/shared mobility where it stands where its headed/shared-mobility-where-it-stands-where-its-headed_thumbnail.jpeg"}},"Hide Hero":{"value":false},"Has Special Report":{"value":false},"Hero Image Top Offset":{"value":""},"Executive Summary PDF":{"value":null},"Briefing Note PDF":{"value":null},"Research Preview PDF":{"value":null},"Discussion Papers PDF":{"value":null},"Call to Action for E-mail":{"value":"Look toward the future"},"Show Social Share Footer":{"value":false},"IsFullScreenInteractive":{"value":false},"EnableArticleComponents":{"value":false},"InteractiveToUse":null,"Five Fifty Related Items":{"value":[]},"Related Articles Dek":{"value":""},"Five Fifty Branding Dek":{"value":""},"CTA Links":{"value":[]},"Related Articles Title":{"value":""},"Five Fifty Branding Title":{"value":""},"External Link Thumbnail":{"value":{}},"Five-Fifty article background color":{"value":""},"Last Sync By":{"value":"sitecore\\pooja_yadav"},"Last Sync Timestamp":{"value":"2021-08-13T06:05:41Z"},"Standard Image":{"value":{"src":"/~/media/mckinsey/industries/automotive and assembly/our insights/shared mobility where it stands where its headed/png_mck-tickettoride-hero_1536x1536.png","alt":"Shared mobility: Where it stands, where it's headed","width":"1536","height":"1536","Description":""}},"Display Date":{"value":"2021-08-11T00:00:00Z"},"SEO Description":{"value":""},"Description":{"value":"Having weathered a pandemic, regulatory whiplash, and a host of other hurdles, shared mobility endures.
